Below is a more technical plan for implementing PromptWizard as a single specialized agent in NOVA, while still keeping its underlying multi-step (Mutate → Critique → Synthesis) approach. We’ll describe how two-layer memory (ephemeral + semantic), emergent task detection, agent spawning, and the Slack-like UI come together in this design.

1. Why a Single Specialized Agent “PromptWizardAgent”?
	1.	Generality
	•	Since PromptWizard logic can optimize any user prompt beyond just complex tasks, making it a dedicated (but singular) agent streamlines usage.
	•	The user simply calls upon "PromptWizardAgent" whenever they want iterative prompt improvements—be it domain constraints, examples, or advanced scenarios.
	2.	Internal Sub-Steps
	•	Instead of explicitly spawning separate sub-agents (Mutate, Critique, Synthesis), we can keep those functionalities inside one agent’s code.
	•	This means from the user’s or Nova’s perspective, we see only a single “PromptWizardAgent,” but internally it still does multi-phase logic.
	3.	Simpler Slack-Like UI
	•	The Slack-like system sees one ephemeral sub-thread for “PromptWizard #XYZ.”
	•	The user doesn’t have to juggle multiple mini-agent channels (like a separate “MutateAgent” channel). The internal steps are hidden or summarized.

2. Architectural Components

Below are the key building blocks:
	1.	PromptWizardAgent (specialized)
	•	Maintains internal states for the “Mutate,” “Critique,” and “Synthesis” steps.
	•	Optionally also includes a minimal “Scoring” step if needed.
	2.	Ephemeral Memory (vector store)
	•	Stores partial transformations and intermediate “prompt variants” that the agent is generating.
	•	Freed after the session or sub-thread ends, unless user decides to keep them longer.
	3.	Semantic Memory (Neo4j)
	•	Final or “best” prompt + curated examples can be stored as a “PromptWizardOutput” node.
	•	If emergent tasks appear (like “Need domain facts?), we record them in the tasks DAG. Possibly we also store a summary of conflicts or “wrong routes” as knowledge entries.
	4.	Emergent Task Detection
	•	If the agent’s “Critique” logic repeatedly fails or identifies missing domain data, it triggers a new sub-task in the DAG, e.g. “(Task) gather domain info.”
	•	The user sees that emergent sub-task, can confirm or discard.
	5.	Slack-Like UI
	•	The user calls “PromptWizardAgent” in a sub-thread or ephemeral conversation.
	•	The agent’s iterative cycles are posted as short summaries: “Iteration #1 → improved prompt. Iteration #2 → final examples.”
	•	If the user wants more iteration, they say “Continue,” otherwise we finalize.

3. Detailed Plan

3.1. Agent Spawning & Flow
	1.	User says in the main Nova channel: “Please refine my prompt about X. I want it to be less ambiguous.”
	2.	NOVA sees “Refine prompt” → triggers “PromptWizard #NNN” emergent sub-task.
	•	The user or system auto-approves that sub-task.
	3.	NOVA calls spawnSpecializedAgent(agentName="PromptWizardAgent", taskId=NNN) → returns a new ephemeral sub-thread: #promptwizard_NNN.
	4.	In the sub-thread, the PromptWizardAgent starts the iterative cycle:
	1.	Mutate Step (internally): Creates multiple prompt variants.
	2.	Critique Step: Critically examines them, possibly referencing domain-labeled knowledge from Neo4j or ephemeral memory.
	3.	Synthesis Step: Merges the best ideas, yields a “Refined Prompt.”
	4.	The user sees an iteration summary (“Iteration #1 complete, final prompt is…”).
	5.	The user can say “Yes, that’s enough,” or “Continue to iteration #2.”

3.2. Emergent Sub-Tasks
	1.	If the Critique sub-step finds repeated contradictions or missing domain info, it triggers:
	•	POST /api/tasks/graph/addNode with title “(Task) gather domain data for X.”
	2.	The user sees “(Task) gather domain data for X” in the tasks DAG tab, pending approval.
	3.	If user approves, maybe a separate ephemeral agent or user action resolves that sub-task, providing new domain knowledge. Then the wizard iteration can resume.

3.3. Two-Layer Memory Interplay
	1.	Ephemeral (vector store):
	•	Each iteration’s mutated prompts, critiques, partial expansions are stored here. We don’t clutter up the semantic layer with these ephemeral transformations.
	2.	Semantic (Neo4j):
	•	If the final refined prompt is valuable, or the user explicitly says “Store final result,” the agent calls neo4j.storePromptWizardOutput(...).
	•	If emergent sub-tasks produce brand new knowledge or domain facts, the agent calls neo4j.addConcept(...) or neo4j.addRelation(...).

4. Slack-Like UI/UX
	1.	Tasks Tab
	•	Shows “PromptWizard #NNN” as a sub-task. Initially “in_progress.”
	•	If the wizard spawns any emergent sub-tasks, they appear as well.
	2.	Main Chat
	•	The user sees short announcements: “PromptWizard #NNN is active in sub-thread #promptwizard_NNN.” They can jump in if they want.
	3.	Sub-Thread #promptwizard_NNN
	•	The agent posts iteration updates:

Iteration #1:
  - Mutated Prompts: [v1, v2, v3]
  - Critique: [Missing domain context, ambiguous phrasing]
  - Synthesis: "Refined Prompt" => ...


	•	The user can type “Repeat iteration,” or “Done.”

	4.	Knowledge Tab
	•	If the final prompt or new domain facts are stored, we see a “PromptWizardOutput” node or new domain relationships.

5. Internal Implementation

5.1. PromptWizardAgent (Single Class/Module)
	•	Properties:
	1.	ephemeral_memory_ref: pointer to ephemeral store for partial expansions,
	2.	task_id: so it can report updates to the tasks DAG,
	3.	domain_context: if any, referencing user’s domain from semantic memory.
	•	Methods:
	1.	runIteration(basePrompt):
	•	mutatePrompt(basePrompt) → returns a list of variations,
	•	critiquePrompts(listOfVariations) → returns feedback and scores,
	•	synthesize(variations, feedback) → merges them into a refined prompt.
	2.	detectMissingDomainOrContradiction(refinedPrompt, feedback):
	•	If contradiction found, calls spawnEmergentTask(...).
	3.	finalizePrompt(refinedPrompt):
	•	Possibly store in semantic memory as a “PromptWizardOutput” node.

5.2. Emergent Task Creation
	•	If repeated attempts fail or the agent sees it lacks needed domain knowledge, it calls:
	•	POST /api/tasks/graph/addNode → "title": "Need domain knowledge for BFSI leftover", "type":"research", "status":"pending".
	•	The user or Nova can accept that new sub-task in the tasks tab, fetch knowledge or confirm it’s not needed.

6. Example Scenario (Coding Context)
	1.	User: “NOVA, refine my coding instructions. I want a data ingestion microservice with concurrency, focusing on TDD.”
	2.	PromptWizard sub-thread:
	•	Iteration #1:
	•	Mutate: 3 variations of instructions (some mention “threading,” some mention “async,” some mention “PySpark”).
	•	Critique (internal chain-of-thought logic) sees we might be missing domain knowledge on “pool size limits.” Possibly triggers an emergent sub-task “(Task) gather concurrency doc references.”
	•	Synthesis: merges the best approach to concurrency + TDD.
	3.	The user sees a short summary: “Iteration #1 suggests a concurrency approach with concurrent.futures; we lack doc references about pool size. A new sub-task was created #345. Approve or skip?”
	4.	If user or a doc agent resolves that sub-task, iteration #2 uses the newly found doc detail.
	5.	The final output: “Your refined coding instructions are: … + TDD steps.” Possibly stored in semantic memory if the user chooses.

7. Why This Architecture is Sufficient
	1.	No Need for separate sub-channels for Mutate/Critique/Synthesis.
	2.	The user sees a single “PromptWizardAgent” in the Slack-like UI.
	3.	The agent’s iterative approach is still multi-phase, but it’s internal.
	4.	We handle emergent tasks if we encounter contradictions or missing data.
	5.	The ephemeral memory ensures partial expansions don’t clutter the long-term knowledge graph, but the final refined product can be saved for future re-use.

8. Conclusion

Yes, making PromptWizard a specialized single agent in NOVA is both simpler and more universal:
	•	One ephemeral agent that performs the entire “Mutate → Critique → Synthesize” cycle internally for any user prompt (including coding instructions).
	•	Ties into two-layer memory for ephemeral expansions vs. final storage in semantic memory.
	•	If new complexities arise, emergent sub-tasks appear in the DAG.
	•	Works seamlessly with the Slack-like UI: user sees only one sub-thread for the wizard, minimal overhead.

Hence, for daily usage—any time a user wants to refine or systematically improve their prompt or instructions—PromptWizardAgent is spawned as a single specialized agent, carrying out those iterative steps behind the scenes, aided by ephemeral memory, emergent tasks, and chain-of-thought expansions where needed.
