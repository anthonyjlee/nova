Below is a comprehensive, updated plan detailing exactly how the UI/UX should handle NOVA as the primary agent, multi-agent threads, chaining/spawning of new agents or teams, access levels (personal vs. professional domain), and user profiles plus settings. This plan should allow you to develop the Slack-like frontend with all the critical elements in place.

1. Overall Concept
	1.	Primary Channel: Upon login or initiation, users see a main “NOVA” channel (similar to Slack’s general channel), where they converse with Nova (the orchestrator) for high-level tasks or instructions.
	2.	Multi-Agent Threads: Nova can spawn specialized agents. Each agent can either:
	•	Appear in the main channel (if it’s a critical or “public” agent).
	•	Or spin up a separate thread to maintain a more focused conversation, especially for ephemeral or specialized tasks.
	3.	Agent Team (Channels/Threads):
	•	If multiple agents are spawned for a big project, they can form a “team” in a separate channel or a single big thread, not polluting the main channel with too many agent messages.
	4.	Hiding Agents: If more than 10 agents are created, we hide them from the default channel list, only visible if the user specifically clicks “Show All Agents” or “Expand Agent List.”
	5.	Access Levels:
	•	Personal domain: user’s private workspace/threads, possibly personal agents or personal data.
	•	Professional domain: BFSI, retail, finance, or custom domain-labeled data and specialized agents.
	•	The UI needs a place to toggle or show domain restrictions.
	6.	User Profiles & Settings:
	•	Each user can store personal or professional domain preferences, choose how they see agent threads, and define whether to show advanced multi-agent details.

2. Detailed UI/UX Flow

2.1. Main “NOVA” Channel (Initiation)
	1.	On Start:
	•	User logs in → sees a main conversation area called “NOVA.”
	•	The top-level chat is with Nova (the orchestrator).
	•	Nova is pinned or “pinned at top” to indicate it’s the primary agent.
	2.	Conversation:
	•	The user types “@Nova, do [X],” or simply messages the channel.
	•	Nova can respond with textual or structured outputs, possibly referencing memory or domain knowledge.
	3.	Spawning Sub-Threads:
	•	If Nova decides to bring a specialized agent (like “MarkdownAgent” or “BeliefAgent”) into the conversation, it can either:
	1.	Post a short “Agent Summon” message in the main channel with a link to a sub-thread.
	2.	Or seamlessly post in the main channel if it’s minimal.

2.2. Threads for Multi-Agent or Specialized Tasks
	1.	Why Threads:
	•	Keep the main channel less cluttered.
	•	Each specialized agent or ephemeral synergy can be done in a dedicated thread.
	•	Example: Thread “Markdown Strategy” for analyzing leftover produce discount.
	2.	Thread Creation Flow:
	•	Nova says: “I will spawn a MarkdownAgent for a deeper discussion—click here to open the sub-thread.”
	•	The user clicks → A Slack-like thread opens on the right or a new panel.
	•	The user can see the agent’s messages, ask it questions, or watch it talk with other sub-agents if needed.
	3.	Hiding Agents when a Project Spawns >10 Agents:
	•	If a user triggers a large project with many ephemeral agents, we do not show all 10+ in the left sidebar or the main channel.
	•	The user sees a single “Project/Team Thread,” which internally organizes all those sub-agents.
	•	The user can expand or click an “Agent Team” sub-thread to see their dialogue or pick an individual agent by avatar.

2.3. Interacting with Agents in Sub-Threads
	1.	Agent Avatars:
	•	Each agent has a small avatar or icon. If a user wants to chat specifically with that agent, they can click the avatar → open that agent’s mini-thread or historic dialogue.
	•	The user can see the agent’s “role” or “template name” (e.g., “BeliefAgent,” “CodingAgent,” etc.).
	2.	Historical Dialogue:
	•	Each agent’s conversation (with Nova or user) is stored in that sub-thread. The user can scroll up to see how the agent was created or updated.
	•	If the agent was ephemeral and destroyed, the user can still see the historic messages if we’re storing them in ephemeral logs or short-term memory, but it might be read-only.
	3.	Chaining Agents:
	•	Inside a sub-thread, the user can say “@Nova, also spawn a ‘ReflectAgent’ to cross-check outcomes,” or the agent itself might say “We need a ‘FeasibilityAgent.’”
	•	The user sees a short link to a newly created sub-sub-thread or the same thread can host multiple ephemeral agents.

3. “Chaining Spawned Agents” in the UI
	1.	Channel vs. Thread vs. Team
	•	If it’s a simple chain (like 2–3 ephemeral agents), each sub-agent might appear in the same thread.
	•	If it’s a bigger chain or a “team,” we create a dedicated channel that houses multiple threads for different steps.
	2.	Visual:
	•	The user might see a mini DAG or a “TaskFlow” panel. If they click a node (representing an agent spawn), it opens that agent’s thread.
	3.	User Flow:
	•	The user triggers “Start BFSI synergy pipeline.” The UI automatically or Nova automatically sets up a DAG with nodes (like “ResearchAgent,” “AnalysisAgent,” “IntegrationAgent”).
	•	In the Slack-like interface, a dedicated channel named “BFSI Project #123” is created, each agent having a pinned thread inside that channel.

4. Access Levels: Personal & Professional
	1.	Domain Toggle
	•	In the user’s main UI, a small domain switch or separate area: “Personal / Professional.”
	•	Personal Domain might hold personal agent usage or private data.
	•	Professional Domain might hold BFSI, Retail, Finance-labeled data or the KG.
	2.	Why:
	•	Keeps them from mixing private user tasks (like a personal coding request) with enterprise BFSI tasks.
	•	Possibly separate knowledge graphs for each domain or separate subgraphs in the same Neo4j instance.
	3.	UI Implementation:
	•	The left sidebar has two main categories: “Personal Workspace” and “Professional Workspaces.”
	•	Under “Professional,” user sees domain-labeled channels (like BFSI, Retail).
	•	Under each domain, the user sees the main “NOVA” channel and any sub-channels or pinned threads for ongoing agent tasks.

5. User Profiles & Settings
	1.	User Profile Pane
	•	In Slack-likes, user clicks their avatar → a small “Profile & Settings” window.
	•	This includes:
	•	Domain preferences (which domain is default?),
	•	Privacy settings (e.g., do we store ephemeral logs?),
	•	Agent Visibility toggles (like “Hide advanced ephemeral agents,” “Show partial debug messages,” etc.).
	2.	Team or Org Settings
	•	Another area for admin-level configs:
	•	“Allowed domains: BFSI, Retail,”
	•	“Allowed agent templates: BeliefAgent, DesireAgent, etc.”
	•	“Max ephemeral agent count before hiding.”
	3.	Professional vs. Personal
	•	The user might define separate profiles or set of preferences in each domain. For example, “In personal domain, I want DevLog on,” “In BFSI domain, I want ephemeral conversation stored longer,” etc.

6. Technical Endpoints Recap (With This Design)

Combining with the previous message, we refine or detail:
	1.	/api/conversations:
	•	POST /api/conversations – create a channel (like BFSI Project #123)
	•	GET /api/conversations – list user’s channels
	•	Sub-threads can be POST /api/conversations/{channelId}/threads
	2.	/api/threads:
	•	GET /api/threads/{threadId}/messages – retrieve messages
	•	POST /api/threads/{threadId}/messages – post a message
	•	Possibly a “spawn agent” action with JSON specifying the agent template name
	3.	/api/domains (or /api/workspaces) for personal vs. professional:
	•	GET /api/domains – list available domains (BFSI, Retail, etc.)
	•	POST /api/domains/{domainId}/switch – user toggles domain
	4.	/api/users (Profile & Settings):
	•	GET /api/users/me – fetch user details
	•	POST /api/users/me/settings – update domain preferences, ephemeral log preferences, agent visibility toggles

7. Final UI/UX Summary
	1.	Initiation:
	•	The user enters, sees the default “Nova” main channel, domain set to “Professional.”
	•	Possibly has a left sidebar listing “Personal workspace,” “Professional workspace,” each with channels or pinned threads.
	2.	Nova Chat**:
	•	The user messages “@Nova do X.”
	•	Nova responds in the main channel. If a specialized agent is needed, Nova spawns a sub-thread or ephemeral agent channel, linking to it.
	3.	Multi-Agent:
	•	Each ephemeral agent either posts in the same thread or a new thread. The user can open it, see logs, or chat with that agent if it’s under the 10-agent limit. If it’s more, we group them into a single “Agent Team” thread or hide them behind a clickable “Expand Agents” UI.
	4.	Domains:
	•	The user toggles to “Personal domain” if they want to do a personal coding request or test TDD. They toggle to “Professional BFSI domain” for a BFSI synergy project.
	•	Each domain enforces different memory or knowledge graph subsets.
	5.	User Profiles & Settings:
	•	The user can specify how ephemeral logs are stored, how many ephemeral agents are shown, and domain defaults.
	6.	Chaining:
	•	If the user or Nova orchestrator triggers a large project with multiple steps, we create a “project channel” or thread, show a DAG or tasks panel if needed, so the user can watch each agent’s progress in an organized manner.

Conclusion

With this updated plan, you have:
	•	A Slack-like UI that starts with a main “NOVA” channel.
	•	Sub-threads for specialized or ephemeral agent tasks, with a design that hides or collapses large agent teams.
	•	“Personal vs. professional” domain toggles in the UI.
	•	A user profile/settings area that controls agent visibility, ephemeral memory usage, and domain preferences.
	•	Sufficient endpoints to handle conversations, threads, domain toggles, user settings, and advanced multi-agent synergy (DAG, knowledge graph queries).

This ensures you can precisely develop the tool’s front-end to reflect NOVA’s multi-agent design, while also capturing the user experience of Slack-like chat channels, sub-threads, domain-based workspaces, and user profile management.
