Below is an updated proposal for ChainOfThoughtAgent as a separate specialized agent within NOVA. This agent focuses on multi-step or “deep” reasoning for any domain-level or advanced debugging tasks, not just prompt optimization. We’ll mirror the style of the PromptWizard proposal (roles, Slack-like UI, ephemeral/semantic memory usage, emergent tasks) but now ChainOfThoughtAgent stands on its own, ensuring chain-of-thought is truly ubiquitous and beneficial for a wide variety of complex tasks.

1. ChainOfThoughtAgent Overview

1.1. Core Purpose
	•	ChainOfThoughtAgent (CoT Agent):
	•	A specialized ephemeral agent that the user (or Nova) summons whenever a multi-step or “deep reasoning” approach is required for tasks beyond simple instructions or prompt optimization.
	•	Iterates partial reasoning expansions in ephemeral memory, searching for solutions or frameworks to handle domain-level complexities (e.g., BFSI leftover scenario, advanced math proofs, concurrency code debugging, etc.).
	•	Spawns emergent tasks in the DAG if it encounters contradictions, missing knowledge, or sub-problems requiring domain expertise or external data.

1.2. Why a Separate Agent?
	•	Generalization:
	•	The CoT Agent is not specialized in “prompt optimization.” Instead, it’s used for broad problem-solving—especially in complex domains where iterative step-by-step logic is crucial.
	•	Ubiquitous Skill:
	•	Chain-of-thought is valuable for BFSI modeling, advanced debugging, or TDD breakdown steps, not just rewriting user prompts.
	•	Clearer UI:
	•	The user or Nova chooses “ChainOfThoughtAgent” explicitly when a multi-step reasoning approach is needed, avoiding the mixing of “prompt optimization” logic with “any domain logic.”

2. Agent Team & Slack-Like UI
	1.	Slack-Like Channel or Sub-Thread:
	•	When the user says, “NOVA, I need a thorough chain-of-thought on BFSI leftover scenario,” Nova spawns “ChainOfThought #NNN.”
	•	A new ephemeral sub-thread #chain_of_thought_NNN is created for the CoT Agent’s expansions.
	2.	Messages & Summaries:
	•	The CoT Agent posts each “reasoning iteration” as a short block, or an aggregated summary if the expansions are large.
	•	The user can see partial reasoning steps, or a summarized version if they prefer minimal spam.
	3.	User Interactions:
	•	The user can type: “Continue reasoning,” “Stop,” or “Refine assumption #2.”
	•	The CoT Agent updates the ephemeral memory accordingly.
	4.	Integration with the Task DAG:
	•	Each CoT session is typically a sub-task in “in_progress” state. If the CoT Agent triggers emergent sub-tasks (like “Need domain doc,” “Check BFSI reg data,” “Try a new concurrency approach”), those appear in the tasks tab for user approval.

3. Internal Flow & Logic

3.1. Step-by-Step Reasoning in Ephemeral Memory
	1.	Initialization:
	•	The CoT Agent gets a “challenge statement” (e.g., BFSI leftover scenario or advanced concurrency debugging).
	•	It references ephemeral memory for partial domain knowledge or code logs if relevant.
	2.	Iterative Reasoning:
	1.	The agent forms a partial step or hypothesis about the scenario.
	2.	It checks for internal contradictions or missing info. Possibly tries alternative routes if it sees a potential conflict.
	3.	Summarizes the step or route in ephemeral memory.
	3.	Wrong Route or Contradiction:
	•	If a route proves contradictory after repeated tries, it logs a “wrong route.” Possibly spawns an emergent task: “(Task) Clarify domain constraints” or “(Task) Oracle LLM check.”
	•	The user sees that new sub-task in the tasks DAG, decides if they want to gather knowledge or ask a bigger LLM.

3.2. Finalizing Output
	•	Once the CoT Agent converges on a stable solution or an incomplete conclusion:
	•	If stable, it returns “Here’s the final multi-step solution / reasoning.”
	•	The user or system can store that final summary in the semantic memory (Neo4j) if it’s domain-labeled knowledge or code approach.
	•	If incomplete, it logs “We gave up or found an unresolvable conflict,” leaving the user to decide next steps.

4. Two-Layer Memory Integration
	1.	Ephemeral Memory (Vector Store):
	•	The chain-of-thought expansions remain ephemeral, so we don’t bloat the knowledge graph with partial or contradictory steps.
	•	The agent can do partial summarization if expansions grow large.
	2.	Semantic Memory (Neo4j):
	•	The final or stable outcome can be recorded as a concept or relationship:
	•	“:ChainOfThoughtSolution { domain: BFSI, summary: ‘…’ }”
	•	Emergent tasks also appear in the tasks DAG as nodes, referencing the chain-of-thought session if needed.

5. Emergent Task Detection & Sub-Problems

5.1. Emergent Tasks from Contradictions
	•	If the CoT Agent repeatedly sees contradictory domain data or unclear user instructions, it triggers a new sub-task: e.g., “(Task) Retrieve BFSI leftover risk stats.”
	•	The user sees that in the tasks tab as a “pending” item. If they confirm, the system might spawn a “DocAgent” to gather that data or ask the user directly.

5.2. Additional Agent Calls
	•	The CoT Agent can also call on or spawn ephemeral specialized agents:
	•	“ApiDocsAgent” if it needs updated library references,
	•	“CodingOrchestratorAgent” if it needs actual code generation,
	•	“FeasibilityAgent” if the user’s request is huge.

6. Example Usage Scenario
	1.	User: “NOVA, help me step by step reason about BFSI leftover risk. We have partial data from last quarter.”
	2.	Nova spawns “ChainOfThought #315” sub-thread.
	3.	ChainOfThoughtAgent:
	1.	Step 1: Analyze leftover risk data. Finds missing doc references.
	2.	Spawns emergent sub-task: “Gather leftover BFSI doc.”
	3.	The user (or a sub-agent) completes that sub-task, providing the doc.
	4.	The CoT Agent continues steps 2–3, refining logic. Possibly tries an alternative approach if it hits a dead end.
	5.	Final step: “Conclusion: BFSI leftover risk is 10–15%. Consider X approach.”
	4.	The user sees a final ephemeral chain-of-thought summary or a simple “Here’s the final logic.” They can store it in the knowledge graph if they want.

7. Slack-Like UI & The Single CoT Agent Approach
	1.	Single “ChainOfThoughtAgent”:
	•	The user or Nova picks it from a standard list of specialized agents for deep reasoning tasks.
	•	A sub-thread is created each time it’s spawned.
	2.	User Experience:
	•	They see iterative reasoning results or a summarized chain-of-thought.
	•	If the user wants a “less verbose” approach, the agent can hide detailed expansions, only showing aggregator messages.
	3.	No Overlap with Prompt Optimization:
	•	If the user wants to refine a prompt, they use “PromptWizardAgent.”
	•	If the user wants to reason about BFSI or debugging concurrency, they use “ChainOfThoughtAgent.”
	•	This clarity helps the user pick the right tool for the right job.

8. Conclusion

Since chain-of-thought is ubiquitous, we keep a dedicated ChainOfThoughtAgent as a specialized agent. The user (or Nova) summons it for any domain-level or advanced debugging tasks that benefit from a multi-step approach. This agent:
	1.	Uses ephemeral memory for partial expansions, final semantic memory for solutions if relevant.
	2.	Spawns emergent tasks if contradictions or missing data appear.
	3.	Integrates seamlessly with the tasks DAG (for sub-task management) and Slack UI (one sub-thread per CoT session).

Hence, the ChainOfThoughtAgent stands as a general multi-step reasoning solution in NOVA’s ecosystem, distinct from the “PromptWizardAgent” which is specialized for prompt refinement.
