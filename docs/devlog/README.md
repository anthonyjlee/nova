# Development Log

This directory contains daily development logs documenting changes, improvements, and decisions made during the development of the NIA system.

## Core Architecture

The system is built on three key pillars:

1. Memory System:
- Two-layer architecture (episodic/semantic)
- Pattern-based consolidation
- Domain boundary enforcement

2. Agent Inheritance:
- BaseAgent: Core memory operations
- TinyTroupeAgent: State and learning
- Specialized Agents: Domain expertise

3. Graph Integration:
- DAG for runtime execution
- Neo4j for pattern storage
- SwarmGraphIntegration bridge

## Key Components

1. Memory Architecture:
```python
class TwoLayerMemorySystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.episodic = EpisodicLayer(vector_store)
        self.semantic = SemanticLayer(neo4j_store)
```

2. Agent System:
```python
class BaseAgent:
    async def store_memory(self, content: Any):
        return await self.memory_system.store_experience(...)

class TinyTroupeAgent(TinyPerson, BaseAgent):
    async def process(self, content: Dict):
        await self.store_memory(...)
        await self.learn_concept(...)
```

3. Graph Integration:
```python
class SwarmGraphIntegration:
    async def instantiate_pattern(self, pattern_id: str):
        pattern = await self.store.get_pattern(pattern_id)
        dag = SwarmDAG()
        # Convert pattern to DAG
```

## Current Status

- Memory system testing in progress
- Profile adaptations being implemented
- Graph integration being refined
- Frontend development pending memory system completion
