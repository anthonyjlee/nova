  * thread_manager.py: Thread lifecycle management
  * dependencies.py: FastAPI service dependencies
  * app.py: Main FastAPI application
  * endpoints.py: API endpoints
  * websocket_endpoints.py: WebSocket handlers

2. Memory System:

  * embedding.py: Text embedding service

3. Storage Layer:
- src/nia/core/neo4j/
  * agent_store.py: Agent persistence
  * base_store.py: Base Neo4j operations
  * concept_manager.py: Knowledge graph management

4. Test Files:
- scripts/
  * test_thread_storage.py: Thread storage validation

  * test_thread.py: Thread operations testing

5. Configuration:
- config.ini: Core service configuration
- scripts/docker/docker-compose.yml: Docker services

## Core Architecture

The system is built on three key pillars:

1. Memory System:
- Two-layer architecture (episodic/semantic)
- Pattern-based consolidation
- Domain boundary enforcement

2. Agent Inheritance:
- BaseAgent: Core memory operations
- TinyTroupeAgent: State and learning
- Specialized Agents: Domain expertise

3. Graph Integration:
- DAG for runtime execution
- Neo4j for pattern storage
- SwarmGraphIntegration bridge

## Key Components

1. Memory Architecture:
```python
class TwoLayerMemorySystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.episodic = EpisodicLayer(vector_store)
        self.semantic = SemanticLayer(neo4j_store)
```

2. Agent System:
```python
class BaseAgent:
    async def store_memory(self, content: Any):
        return await self.memory_system.store_experience(...)

class TinyTroupeAgent(TinyPerson, BaseAgent):
    async def process(self, content: Dict):
        await self.store_memory(...)
        await self.learn_concept(...)
```

3. Graph Integration:
```python
class SwarmGraphIntegration:
    async def instantiate_pattern(self, pattern_id: str):
        pattern = await self.store.get_pattern(pattern_id)
        dag = SwarmDAG()
        # Convert pattern to DAG
```

## Current Status

- Frontend development in active progress:
  * Graph visualization complete with node labels and metadata
  * WebSocket integration working for real-time updates
  * Chat interface implementation next priority
- Memory system testing complete
- Graph integration refined and working
- Profile adaptations implemented
