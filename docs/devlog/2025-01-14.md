- Metadata updates

3. Testing Priority:
- Start with basic message flow
- Test real-time updates
- Verify thread persistence
- Check participant handling
- Test system interactions

## Core Infrastructure

1. Vector Store Operations:
- Successfully connected to Qdrant
- Created and verified all required indexes
- Successfully stored nova-team thread with proper metadata
- Successfully retrieved and verified the stored thread

2. Thread Data Structure:
- Content is stored directly without unnecessary JSON serialization
- Metadata fields are properly prefixed and typed
- All required fields are present and correctly formatted

3. Key Improvements:
- No more recursion errors from h11 library
- Proper handling of nested objects
- Correct metadata serialization

## Server Verification

Full system startup successful:
1. Docker Services:
   - Neo4j running and initialized ✅
   - Redis running ✅
   - Qdrant running ✅
2. LMStudio connected ✅
3. Celery worker started ✅
4. FastAPI server running ✅
5. Frontend server running ✅

## Test Results

Unit tests passed successfully after fixing serialization issues:

1. Vector Store Tests:
- Connection established ✅
- Vector storage successful (point_id: 2755c82f-678e-439b-ae33-ae4c4c82908e) ✅
- Vector search working (0 results as expected for new store) ✅

2. Memory System Tests:
- Initialization successful ✅
- Experience storage successful (memory_id: 88357fad-6853-4c6f-9cfb-37dab5398643) ✅
- Episodic query working (0 results as expected for new store) ✅

## JSON Serialization Issues

Important findings while debugging vector store recursion errors:

1. Root Cause Analysis:
- Maximum recursion depth exceeded in h11 library during HTTP requests
- Issue occurs in vector_store.add method when handling headers
- Problem stems from complex nested object serialization

2. Affected Components:
- VectorStore: Unnecessary JSON serialization of content and metadata
- ThreadManager: Over-serialization of thread content and participants
- Neo4jMemoryStore: Redundant content serialization

3. Implemented Fixes:
- VectorStore:
  * Handle content directly without JSON serialization
  * Process metadata fields with proper type handling
  * Keep content in its original form for storage
- ThreadManager:
  * Remove redundant JSON parsing of thread content
  * Store participants and metadata directly
  * Simplify content handling in list_threads
- Neo4jMemoryStore:
  * Store content directly without JSON serialization
  * Maintain original data structure

4. Key Improvements:
- Reduced unnecessary serialization/deserialization cycles
- Proper handling of complex nested objects
- Better type preservation across storage layers
- Eliminated recursion issues in HTTP requests

## Connection Configuration Update

Important findings while debugging Neo4j and Qdrant connections:

1. Docker Network vs Direct Access
- Services (Neo4j, Qdrant, Redis) run in Docker with "nova_network"
- When accessing from within Docker (e.g. FastAPI container), use service names ("neo4j", "qdrant")
- When accessing from outside Docker (e.g. local scripts), use "localhost"

2. Configuration Management
- Added Neo4j and Qdrant settings to config.ini
- Made connections configurable to handle both Docker and local access
- Neo4j settings:
  ```ini
  [NEO4J]
  uri = bolt://localhost:7687
  user = neo4j
  password = password
  ```
- Qdrant settings:
  ```ini
  [QDRANT]
  host = qdrant
  port = 6333
  ```

3. Connection Handling
- Updated TwoLayerMemorySystem to use config for Neo4j
- Updated VectorStore to use config for Qdrant
- Both services now properly handle connection retries
- Added better error logging for connection issues

4. Service Dependencies
- FastAPI server requires:
  - Neo4j for semantic memory
  - Qdrant for vector storage
  - Redis for caching
- All services must be running before starting FastAPI

## Server Startup Improvements

1. Logging Configuration:
- Added structured JSON logging
- Separated console and file logging
- Created service-specific log directories
- Added proper log rotation and naming

2. Service Health Checks:
- Added proper Neo4j health check with retries
- Added Qdrant HTTP health check
- Added proper retry logic and timeouts
- Better error handling for service failures

3. Code Fixes:
- Added missing Path import in thread_manager.py
- Fixed uvicorn logging configuration
- Added proper error handling for startup
- Better service initialization sequence

4. Memory System Initialization:
- Successfully initialized vector store
- Created and verified all required indexes
- Established connections to Neo4j and Qdrant
- Added proper connection retry logic
