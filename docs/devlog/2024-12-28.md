## Technical Details

### Parsing Agent Updates
- Added specific handling for greeting responses
- Improved dialogue field extraction
- Enhanced metadata handling for responses
- Added validation for response confidence levels

### UI Launch Flow
- Implemented async server launch with proper event handling
- Added server status verification
- Improved error reporting and logging
- Added graceful shutdown handling for server cleanup

## Unresolved Issues
- Unable to successfully launch the gradio app despite multiple attempts at fixing the async handling
- Tried various approaches including:
  - Using event system with load() handler
  - Using server status tracking
  - Implementing timeout and error handling
  - Adding graceful shutdown
- Error persists: "Error launching UI: 0"

## Next Steps
- Debug and fix gradio app launch issues:
  - Investigate root cause of launch error
  - Consider alternative approaches to async handling
  - Look into gradio version compatibility
- Test and verify orchestration tab updates once UI is launching
- Consider adding more robust server health checks
- Look into adding more comprehensive error recovery mechanisms
