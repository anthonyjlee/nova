# 2024-12-30 Development Log

## Major Refactoring Progress

### Code Reorganization
- Moved concept and JSON utilities to memory/types/
- Reorganized memory system structure for better modularity
- Relocated agent-specific code to appropriate directories
- Updated import paths across the codebase

### Memory System Improvements
- Fixed relationship creation logic in `test_two_layer.py`
- Updated parameter handling for UNWIND queries to ensure proper relationship creation
- Added direct relationship creation support in mock Neo4j store
- Improved test coverage for semantic store relationship handling

### Technical Details
- Modified MockSession class to properly handle both UNWIND and direct MERGE relationship queries
- Updated parameter handling to prioritize parameters over kwargs for UNWIND queries
- Added explicit relationship creation in test_semantic_store_reuse to verify functionality
- Fixed relationship tracking in mock store to ensure proper state management
- Restructured memory types and utilities for better organization

### Implementation Plan Progress
- Completed initial phase of file reorganization
- Improved memory system test coverage
- Prepared for TinyTroupe integration
- Enhanced memory consolidation capabilities

### Nova Core Implementation
- Created nova directory structure with core and tasks subdirectories
- Implemented Nova's self-model in Neo4j with domain separation
- Added initialization protocol with user context handling
- Implemented auto-approval system for user proxy capabilities
- Added comprehensive test suite for initialization components

#### Self-Model Features
- System state tracking in Neo4j
- Capability management
- Domain separation (personal vs. professional)
- Reflection recording
- Access control for specialized agents

#### Initialization Protocol
- Structured initialization sequence
- Memory system verification
- User context processing
- Domain access control setup
- Auto-approval rules configuration

## Next Steps
- Continue Phase 1: Core Agent Migration
  * Next agent to migrate: MetaAgent to nova/core/meta.py
  * Update remaining specialized agents with domain awareness
  * Complete agent test coverage
- Implement additional memory consolidation features
- Add more comprehensive relationship validation
- Complete remaining file migrations
- Begin FastAPI + React UI development
