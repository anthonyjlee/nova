## WebSocket Test Improvements

### Completed Tasks
- Updated mock memory system to properly handle async operations:
  * Added async context manager support
  * Implemented proper async/await patterns
  * Added async iterator support for memory system
  * Fixed collection initialization issues

- Enhanced WebSocket test suite:
  * Added proper async/await support to test functions
  * Improved error handling in mock analytics agent
  * Fixed API key authentication in WebSocket tests
  * Added cleanup mechanisms for WebSocket connections

### Technical Details
- Implemented AsyncIterator pattern for mock memory system to match FastAPI's dependency injection behavior
- Updated mock store implementations to use async methods consistently
- Added proper async context manager support with __aenter__ and __aexit__
- Fixed vector store collection handling in mock implementations

### Current Issues
- Need to set up performance testing infrastructure
- Need to implement metrics collection for load tests
- Need to establish performance baselines for:
  * Memory system operations
  * Agent communication latency
  * Swarm coordination overhead
  * Resource utilization under load

### Next Steps
1. Performance Testing Setup:
   * Set up test infrastructure with monitoring
   * Implement metrics collection system
   * Define performance baselines
   * Create load testing scenarios

2. Load Testing Implementation:
   * Design concurrent operation tests
   * Create resource utilization tests
   * Implement long-running stability tests
   * Add performance regression tests

3. System Optimization:
   * Profile memory system operations
   * Optimize agent communication patterns
   * Enhance resource allocation strategies
   * Implement performance monitoring

### Notes
- Successfully implemented comprehensive swarm integration tests
- Covered all swarm patterns: hierarchical, parallel, sequential, mesh
- Added tests for resource management and scaling
- Implemented domain boundary enforcement tests
- Verified all communication patterns: broadcast, direct, group
- Added round-robin and majority voting swarm type tests
- Tested DAG-based workflow execution
