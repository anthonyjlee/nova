## Integration Testing Progress

### Swarm Architecture Tests
- Implemented comprehensive swarm pattern tests:
  * Hierarchical (supervisor-worker)
  * Parallel (independent processing)
  * Sequential (ordered tasks)
  * Mesh (free-form communication)
- Added tests for swarm types:
  * MajorityVoting with configurable thresholds
  * RoundRobin task distribution
  * GraphWorkflow with DAG validation
- Tested resource management:
  * Dynamic scaling
  * Load balancing
  * Bottleneck detection

### Demo Functionality Tests
- Added test coverage for demo script:
  * Memory storage and retrieval
  * Query parsing and analysis
  * Agent coordination via WebSocket
  * Memory pattern analysis
  * Basic coordination capabilities
- Verified LM Studio integration
- Tested system health checks
- Added Docker service management tests

## WebSocket Test Improvements

### Completed Tasks
- Updated mock memory system to properly handle async operations:
  * Added async context manager support
  * Implemented proper async/await patterns
  * Added async iterator support for memory system
  * Fixed collection initialization issues

- Enhanced WebSocket test suite:
  * Added proper async/await support to test functions
  * Improved error handling in mock analytics agent
  * Fixed API key authentication in WebSocket tests
  * Added cleanup mechanisms for WebSocket connections

### Technical Details
- Implemented AsyncIterator pattern for mock memory system to match FastAPI's dependency injection behavior
- Updated mock store implementations to use async methods consistently
- Added proper async context manager support with __aenter__ and __aexit__
- Fixed vector store collection handling in mock implementations

### Current Issues
- Need to set up performance testing infrastructure
- Need to implement metrics collection for load tests
- Need to establish performance baselines for:
  * Memory system operations
  * Agent communication latency
  * Swarm coordination overhead
  * Resource utilization under load
  * WebSocket connection limits
  * Agent coordination overhead
  * Docker service performance

### Next Steps
1. Performance Testing Setup:
   * Set up test infrastructure with monitoring
   * Implement metrics collection system
   * Define performance baselines
   * Create load testing scenarios
   * Configure Docker monitoring
   * Set up resource tracking

2. Load Testing Implementation:
   * Design concurrent operation tests
   * Create resource utilization tests
   * Implement long-running stability tests
   * Add performance regression tests
   * Test Docker service scaling
   * Verify connection handling

3. System Optimization:
   * Profile memory system operations
   * Optimize agent communication patterns
   * Enhance resource allocation strategies
   * Implement performance monitoring
   * Improve Docker configuration
   * Optimize service startup

### Notes
- Successfully implemented comprehensive swarm integration tests
- Covered all swarm patterns and communication types
- Added tests for resource management and scaling
- Implemented domain boundary enforcement tests
- Added demo functionality test coverage
- Improved Docker service management
- Enhanced system health monitoring
