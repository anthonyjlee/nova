# 2025-01-07 Development Log

## Today's Progress

### Performance Testing Infrastructure
1. Added comprehensive test suite (test_performance.py):
   * Memory system load tests
   * Concurrent agent operations
   * Response time optimization
   * Resource usage profiling
   * WebSocket connection limits
   * Agent coordination overhead

2. Added performance metrics tracking:
   * Response times
   * Memory operations
   * Concurrent operations
   * Error tracking
   * Statistical analysis

3. Added visualization support:
   * Response time distribution
   * Memory operation times
   * Error distribution
   * Performance trends

4. Added HTML report generation:
   * Summary statistics
   * Detailed metrics
   * Visual graphs
   * Error analysis

### Enhanced Error Handling
1. Added comprehensive error handlers (error_handlers.py):
   * Validation errors
   * Nova-specific errors
   * HTTP exceptions
   * General exceptions

2. Added error logging and formatting:
   * Structured error responses
   * Request context tracking
   * Stack trace logging
   * Error categorization

3. Added middleware:
   * Request context (request ID, timing)
   * Response headers (process time, request ID)
   * Error tracking

4. Added error handler tests:
   * Validation error scenarios
   * Nova error handling
   * HTTP error responses
   * General error cases
   * Middleware functionality
   * Response format consistency

### Dependencies Added
1. Performance testing tools:
   * pandas (data analysis)
   * matplotlib (plotting)
   * seaborn (statistical visualization)

## Next Steps
1. Frontend Development:
   * Begin SvelteKit setup
   * Implement three-panel layout
   * Add WebSocket integration

2. Documentation:
   * Update API documentation with error formats
   * Add performance testing guide
   * Document error handling patterns

### Memory System Debugging
1. Memory Storage and Retrieval Issues:
   * File: src/nia/memory/two_layer.py
     - Identified data type mismatch in EpisodicMemory model validation
     - Content field expects string but receiving dictionary in query_episodic method
     - Started refactoring memory query logic to handle content field properly
   
   * File: src/nia/nova/core/endpoints.py
     - Modified store_memory endpoint to wrap content in text field
     - Updated response format to match expected memory structure
     - Added better error handling for validation failures

2. Test Improvements:
   * File: tests/nova/test_demo.py
     - Enhanced test_memory_storage with detailed logging
     - Added debug output for query results
     - Updated test to use correct query format
   
   * File: tests/nova/conftest.py
     - Identified Neo4j connection issues in memory_system fixture
     - Added better cleanup handling for test data
     - Need to fix async cleanup warning

3. Infrastructure Issues:
   * Neo4j Connection:
     - Tests failing due to Neo4j not running (port 7687)
     - Need to ensure Neo4j container is running before tests
     - Configuration in docker-compose.yml needs verification
   
   * Data Flow Problems:
     - Memory storage path: endpoint -> two_layer -> vector_store
     - Content serialization issues at each layer
     - Need consistent data structure throughout the flow

## Notes
- Performance testing infrastructure is now in place with comprehensive metrics and visualization
- Error handling is standardized across all endpoints with structured responses
- Memory system improvements are in progress:
  * Content field handling needs consistent data structure throughout the flow
  * EpisodicMemory model validation needs to be aligned with actual data flow
  * Neo4j connection issues need to be resolved before further memory system testing
  * Async cleanup in test fixtures needs proper await handling
- Next debugging session should focus on:
  * Starting Neo4j container and verifying connection
  * Implementing consistent content field handling across all layers
  * Fixing async cleanup warnings in test fixtures
