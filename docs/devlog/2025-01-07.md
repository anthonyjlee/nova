## Today's Progress

### Performance Testing Infrastructure
1. Added comprehensive test suite (test_performance.py):
   * Memory system load tests
   * Concurrent agent operations
   * Response time optimization
   * Resource usage profiling
   * WebSocket connection limits
   * Agent coordination overhead

2. Added performance metrics tracking:
   * Response times
   * Memory operations
   * Concurrent operations
   * Error tracking
   * Statistical analysis

3. Added visualization support:
   * Response time distribution
   * Memory operation times
   * Error distribution
   * Performance trends

4. Added HTML report generation:
   * Summary statistics
   * Detailed metrics
   * Visual graphs
   * Error analysis

### Enhanced Error Handling
1. Added comprehensive error handlers (error_handlers.py):
   * Validation errors
   * Nova-specific errors
   * HTTP exceptions
   * General exceptions

2. Added error logging and formatting:
   * Structured error responses
   * Request context tracking
   * Stack trace logging
   * Error categorization

3. Added middleware:
   * Request context (request ID, timing)
   * Response headers (process time, request ID)
   * Error tracking

4. Added error handler tests:
   * Validation error scenarios
   * Nova error handling
   * HTTP error responses
   * General error cases
   * Middleware functionality
   * Response format consistency

### Dependencies Added
1. Performance testing tools:
   * pandas (data analysis)
   * matplotlib (plotting)
   * seaborn (statistical visualization)

## Next Steps
1. Frontend Development:
   * Begin SvelteKit setup
   * Implement three-panel layout
   * Add WebSocket integration

2. Documentation:
   * Update API documentation with error formats
   * Add performance testing guide
   * Document error handling patterns

### Memory System Debugging
1. Fixed issues in memory storage and retrieval:
   * Identified data type mismatch in episodic memory queries
   * Fixed content field handling in memory storage
   * Added debug logging for memory operations
   * Started refactoring memory query logic

2. Test Improvements:
   * Enhanced test_memory_storage test with better logging
   * Added debug output for query results
   * Identified Neo4j connection issues in tests

## Notes
- Performance testing infrastructure is now in place
- Error handling is standardized across all endpoints
- Memory system improvements are in progress
- Some tests are failing due to Neo4j connection issues
