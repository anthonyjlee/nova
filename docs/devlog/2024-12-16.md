## Initial Implementation

### Memory System Implementation
- Implemented two-layer memory architecture:
  * Semantic memory layer
  * Episodic memory layer
- Added vector-based storage with semantic search
- Created indexed fields for efficient retrieval:
  * memory_type (keyword)
  * timestamp (keyword)
  * importance (float)

### Agent System Development
- Implemented base agent with vector similarity
- Created specialized agents:
  * BeliefAgent
  * DesireAgent
  * EmotionAgent
  * ReflectionAgent
  * ResearchAgent
  * MetaAgent

### Repository Organization
- Set up proper git repository structure
- Added comprehensive documentation
- Configured .gitignore for Python development
- Added basic test framework

### Memory System Refactoring
- Integrated LMStudio for both completions and embeddings:
  * Replaced sentence-transformers with LMStudio embeddings API
  * Added LMStudio chat completions for agent responses
  * Configured Nomic embed model for semantic search
- Fixed Neo4j query issues:
  * Corrected ORDER BY clauses in memory search
  * Fixed aggregation issues in capabilities query
  * Improved relationship handling
- Enhanced agent response handling:
  * Added proper conversion from LLM responses to agent responses
  * Improved error handling and retries
  * Added structured JSON validation
- Updated system prompts:
  * Made responses more natural and conversational
  * Maintained analytical depth while improving engagement
  * Added better context handling

### Knowledge Graph Enhancement
- Added rich concept extraction and linking:
  * Implemented LLM-based concept extraction
  * Created Concept nodes from extracted concepts
  * Added Topic nodes for categorization
  * Enhanced relationship types
- Expanded graph structure:
  * Memory nodes for experiences
  * Concept nodes for insights
  * Topic nodes for themes
  * AISystem nodes for versions
  * Capability nodes for functions
- Added rich relationships:
  * HAS_CONCEPT: Links memories to concepts
  * RELATED_TO: Shows concept relationships
  * HAS_TOPIC: Categorizes content
  * SIMILAR_TO: Links similar memories
  * CREATED_BY: Tracks memory creation
  * HAS_CAPABILITY: Links system capabilities
  * PREDECESSOR_OF: Shows system evolution

### DateTime Serialization Fixes
- Fixed datetime serialization issues across components
- Added consistent datetime handling across the system

### Vector Store Improvements
- Fixed Qdrant vector store validation issues
- Improved vector store initialization and operations

### Type System Improvements
- Enhanced type handling across components
- Added explicit type information to responses

### LLM Response Parsing Improvements
- Enhanced JSON parsing from LLM responses
- Improved structured output handling
