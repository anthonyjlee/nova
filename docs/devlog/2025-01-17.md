## Initialization Script Improvements

### Thread Management Refactor
- Removed recursive get_thread/store_thread pattern that was causing infinite recursion
- Added direct layer verification before thread creation
- Improved handling of optional semantic store
- Added logging for thread existence to avoid duplicate creation attempts
- Updated Memory creation to match Pydantic schema:
  * Added proper domain_context with validation
  * Fixed timestamp to use UTC timezone
  * Ensured all required fields are present
  * Removed metadata field (not in schema)

### Logging System Overhaul
- Moved logs to test_results/initialization_logs/ to match other components
- Implemented session-based JSON logging with detailed phase tracking:
  * prerequisites_check: Schema, concepts, task states
  * system_thread_exists: Thread found in layers
  * system_thread_creation: New thread details
  * agent_creation_{id}: Individual agent data
  * visualization_creation: Node structure
  * relationship_creation: Relationship counts
  * verification: Final system state

### Console Output Reduction
- Set logging level to WARNING
- Limited console output to phase transitions and errors
- Moved detailed progress information to JSON logs
- Improved error messages for missing prerequisites

### Agent Cleanup
- Added cleanup of existing agents before initialization
- Prevents duplicate agent creation
- Ensures clean state for visualization and relationships

These changes improve the robustness of the initialization process while making it easier to debug issues through structured logging.

## Memory System Optimizations

Made comprehensive optimizations to prevent recursion and improve memory handling:

1. profile_types.py:
- Added minimal serialization support to all models
- Limited array sizes in minimal mode
- Optimized nested object serialization
- Added sync flags

2. profile_manager.py:
- Updated to use minimal serialization when storing in Neo4j
- Optimized profile reconstruction from minimal data
- Added proper cleanup

3. profile_store.py:
- Added indexes for better performance
- Implemented minimal data storage
- Limited result sets
- Added proper cleanup
- Optimized queries

4. two_layer.py:
- Added memory pools for caching
- Optimized memory handling
- Added sync flags
- Added proper cleanup

5. vector_store.py:
- Added connection pooling
- Added timeouts
- Limited result sets
- Added batched operations
- Optimized serialization
- Added proper cleanup

### Key Improvements
1. Connection pooling reduces overhead
2. Minimal serialization reduces data size
3. Memory pools improve performance
4. Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks
5. Sync flags prevent unnecessary operations
6. Timeouts prevent hanging operations
7. Batched operations reduce memory usage
8. Result set limits prevent memory bloat
