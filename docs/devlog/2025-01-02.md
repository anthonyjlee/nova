# 2025-01-02 Development Log

## FastAPI Server Implementation Progress

### Initial Server Setup ✓
- Created FastAPI application structure in nova/core/
- Implemented basic endpoints for analytics and orchestration
- Added WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Set up CORS middleware and basic error handling

### API Endpoints Implemented ✓
- Flow analytics (/api/analytics/flows)
- Resource analytics (/api/analytics/resources)
- Agent analytics (/api/analytics/agents)
- WebSocket for real-time analytics updates
- Flow optimization (/api/orchestration/flows/{flow_id}/optimize)
- Resource allocation (/api/orchestration/resources/allocate)
- Task management (/api/orchestration/tasks/*)
- Agent coordination (/api/orchestration/agents/*)
- Memory operations (/api/orchestration/memory/*)

### Pydantic Models Integration ✓
- Added models directory for type definitions
- Created Pydantic models for:
  * Agent configurations and states
  * Task definitions and tracking
  * Memory operations and structures
  * API request/response schemas
  * Analytics request/response schemas
  * Resource allocation models
  * Flow optimization models

### Security Implementation ✓
- Added authentication with API keys
- Implemented permission-based authorization
- Added rate limiting with sliding window
- Added domain access control
- Request validation with Pydantic models

### Error Handling Enhancement ✓
- Created custom error types
- Added comprehensive error responses
- Implemented retry mechanisms
- Added validation for all endpoints
- Added request/response logging
- Added performance tracking

### Technical Details
- Server Configuration:
  * Host: 127.0.0.1
  * Port: 8003
  * Reload enabled for development
  * Comprehensive logging setup
- TinyTroupe Configuration:
  * Using local API (http://localhost:1234/v1)
  * Default configuration values
  * Need to customize for production use

### Testing Results ✓
- Successfully started FastAPI server with uvicorn
- Fixed TinyTroupe integration:
  * Fixed TinyPerson configuration
  * Updated memory handling
  * Added proper error handling
- Verified all endpoints working:
  * Health check responding
  * API endpoints accessible
  * WebSocket connection working
  * Authentication functioning
  * Rate limiting active
- Fixed WebSocket and rate limiting issues:
  * Fixed WebSocket authentication to work without FastAPI dependencies
  * Added proper rate limiting to HTTP endpoints while keeping WebSocket endpoints separate
  * All test cases passing including WebSocket and rate limiting tests

### Integration Tests Added ✓
- Added comprehensive test suite in tests/nova/test_server.py
- Test coverage includes:
  * API key authentication
  * Rate limiting functionality
  * WebSocket connections
  * All endpoint operations
  * Error handling scenarios
  * Resource management
  * Memory operations
  * Agent coordination

## Next Steps
1. Performance Testing:
   - Load testing WebSocket connections
   - Stress testing rate limiting
   - Benchmark memory operations
   - Profile API response times

2. Add Documentation:
   - API documentation with examples
   - Setup instructions
   - Configuration guide
   - Deployment guide

3. Production Preparation:
   - Add database integration
   - Configure for production
   - Add monitoring
   - Add metrics collection

4. UI Integration:
   - Test with frontend
   - Add WebSocket examples
   - Document API usage
