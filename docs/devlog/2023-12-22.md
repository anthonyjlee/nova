# LMStudio Integration Testing

1. Enhanced Test Infrastructure
- Added real LMStudio integration tests beyond mocks
- Improved test coverage for LLM interactions
- Enhanced test assertions for response validation
- Added comprehensive test cases for various agent scenarios

2. Test Framework Improvements
- Implemented proper LMStudio test fixtures
- Added test utilities for LLM response handling
- Enhanced test setup and teardown procedures
- Improved test isolation and reproducibility

These changes improve the reliability of our testing infrastructure by validating against actual LLM responses rather than just mocks.
