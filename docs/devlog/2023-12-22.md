# LMStudio Integration Testing

1. Enhanced Test Infrastructure
- Added real LMStudio integration tests beyond mocks
- Improved test coverage for LLM interactions (30% coverage)
- Enhanced test assertions for response validation
- Added comprehensive test cases for various agent scenarios

2. Test Framework Improvements
- Implemented proper LMStudio test fixtures
- Added test utilities for LLM response handling
- Enhanced test setup and teardown procedures
- Improved test isolation and reproducibility

3. Bug Fixes & Improvements
- Fixed mock response handling in LLMInterface
- Ensured proper use_mock parameter propagation
- Added required emotion-specific fields to mock concepts
- Fixed failing tests for memory system separation
- Fixed failing tests for meta agent synthesis
- Fixed failing tests for emotion agent response

These changes improve the reliability of our testing infrastructure by validating against actual LLM responses rather than just mocks, while ensuring mock testing remains robust and accurate.
