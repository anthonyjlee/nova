## Frontend Integration

### Service Management Updates
- Added frontend server management to scripts/manage.py
- Frontend server now starts/stops with other services
- Added health checks and status monitoring for frontend
- Updated documentation with new service management commands

### API Improvements
- Added chat/thread endpoints:
  * POST /api/chat/threads/create - Create new thread
  * GET /api/chat/threads/{thread_id} - Get thread details
  * POST /api/chat/threads/{thread_id}/messages - Add message
  * GET /api/chat/threads - List all threads
- Added WebSocket documentation:
  * /api/ws/ws - Real-time analytics updates
  * Support for ping/pong, swarm monitoring, agent coordination
  * Example connection code and message types
- Organized endpoints by functionality:
  * graph - Graph operations and health
  * agents - Agent management and coordination
  * users - Profile and preferences
  * analytics - Insights and monitoring
  * orchestration - Task and resource management
  * chat - Thread and message handling
  * websocket - Real-time updates

### UI Development Progress
- Implemented Slack-inspired three-panel layout:
  * Left sidebar for channels and threads
  * Main chat area with message history
  * Right panel for graph visualization
- Added dark theme styling matching Slack's night shift mode
- Implemented real-time message updates
- Added thread support and unread indicators

### Testing Strategy Update
- Simplified mock tests for core functionality
- Using real Neo4j instance for development
- Improved test maintenance approach
- Added frontend component testing setup

### Chat System Implementation
- Added chat models and endpoints:
  * ThreadRequest/Response for thread management
  * MessageRequest/Response for message handling
  * Memory system integration for thread storage
  * Domain-aware thread organization
  * Real-time message updates via WebSocket
  * Proper error handling and validation

### Graph Visualization Implementation
- Integrated Cytoscape.js for graph visualization:
  * DAG visualization for tasks and agents
  * Knowledge graph visualization for domain knowledge
  * Interactive node details panel with metadata display
  * Zoom and layout controls
  * Thread navigation for task nodes
- Connected to Neo4j for knowledge graph data:
  * Fixed deprecated `id()` function usage
  * Added category inference from node labels
  * Improved node label display using name property
  * Enhanced metadata panel with better description formatting
  * Proper error handling and type safety
- Added advanced search and filtering:
  * Full-text search across node labels, domains, categories
  * Deep search in node metadata values
  * Dynamic domain filtering with auto-populated domain list
  * Combined type and domain filters
- Added mock data support for flow analytics until backend is fixed
- Implemented proper TypeScript types for all graph data

### Next Steps
1. Implement chat frontend components
2. Add real-time message updates via WebSocket
3. Add user profile-based UI adaptations
4. Complete remaining frontend components

### Service Management Improvements
- All services now managed through single command:
  ```bash
  python scripts/manage.py start    # Start all services
  python scripts/manage.py stop     # Stop all services
  python scripts/manage.py restart  # Restart all services
  python scripts/manage.py status   # Check service status
  ```
- Added proper cleanup for all services
- Improved error handling and status reporting
- Better service health monitoring

### Known Issues
- None currently

### Decisions Made
1. Using SvelteKit for frontend development
2. Following Slack's UI patterns for consistency
3. Centralizing service management in manage.py
4. Using real services over mocks for development
