## Swarm Architecture Integration

### Changes Made
1. Extending Nova's Coordination System:
- Enhanced existing group coordination with swarm-specific metadata
- Added swarm-level monitoring to existing resource management
- Integrated swarm metrics into coordination validation
- Extended coordination patterns with swarm-specific behaviors

The key difference from existing coordination is implemented through:

1. Task-Level Coordination (NovaOrchestrationAgent):
```python
class OrchestrationAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        # Task-level state tracking
        self.active_flows = {}        # Flow state management
        self.resource_allocations = {} # Resource tracking
        self.dependency_graph = {}     # Task dependencies
        self.flow_patterns = {}        # Basic flow patterns
```

2. System-Level Swarm Behavior (TinyTroupe integration):
```python
class OrchestrationAgent:
    async def process(self):
        # Get analytics for adaptation
        analytics_result = await self._get_flow_analytics()
        
        # Update emotional state
        if response.concepts:
            self.emotions.update({
                "orchestration_state": concept.get("description")
            })
            
        # Apply collective learning
        await self._apply_analytics_insights()
        
        # Store shared experiences
        await self.store_memory()
```

3. Integration Points:
- Analytics guide resource allocation:
```python
async def _update_resource_allocations(self, resources, analytics):
    # Use analytics predictions for allocation
    predicted_utilization = analytics.get(f"resource_{resource_id}")
    allocation["predicted_utilization"] = predicted_utilization
```

- Emotions influence decisions:
```python
async def orchestrate_and_store(self):
    # Update flow patterns based on emotional state
    if self.emotions["orchestration_state"] == "highly_focused":
        self._update_flow_patterns(patterns)
```

- Memory enables collective learning:
```python
async def _apply_analytics_insights(self):
    # Store insights for future reference
    flow_state["analytics"] = {
        "performance": analytics.get("analytics", {}),
        "predictions": {},
        "optimizations": []
    }
```

### Memory System Integration
The swarm architecture leverages our two-layer memory system:

1. Episodic Layer (Vector Store):
```python
async def _get_allocation_patterns(self):
    """Retrieve recent allocation patterns."""
    patterns = await self.memory_system.episodic.search(
        query="resource_allocation_pattern",
        limit=10,  # Recent patterns only
        metadata_filter={"domain": self.domain}
    )
```
- Stores recent allocation patterns for quick retrieval
- Tracks swarm performance metrics for adaptation
- Maintains short-term interaction patterns
- Enables fast pattern matching for decisions

2. Semantic Layer (Neo4j):
```python
async def store_memory(self, content):
    """Store validated patterns."""
    await self.memory_system.semantic.store.store_concept(
        name=content.get("name"),
        type="swarm_pattern",
        description=content.get("description")
    )
```
- Stores validated swarm patterns long-term
- Maintains agent relationship graphs
- Tracks successful swarm configurations
- Enables knowledge transfer between swarms

3. Integration Points:
```python
class OrchestrationAgent:
    async def _apply_allocation_patterns(self):
        # Get recent patterns from episodic
        recent = await self._get_allocation_patterns()
        
        # Get validated patterns from semantic
        validated = await self.memory_system.semantic.get_patterns()
        
        # Combine and apply patterns
        patterns = self._merge_patterns(recent, validated)
        return self._apply_best_pattern(patterns)
```

### TinyTroupe Integration
The swarm architecture enhances Nova's coordination through TinyTroupe's capabilities:

1. Emotional Integration:
- Enhances Nova's group coordination with emotional context
- Uses emotional states to guide resource allocation
- Improves conflict resolution with sentiment analysis
- Adapts coordination strategies based on group sentiment

2. Goal Alignment:
- Extends Nova's task dependencies with desire-based prioritization
- Enhances group formation with shared objective analysis
- Improves resource allocation through goal alignment
- Adapts coordination patterns based on collective goals

3. Memory Utilization:
- Enhances Nova's coordination history with collective learning
- Improves group formation through shared experiences
- Optimizes resource allocation using historical patterns
- Enables adaptive coordination strategies

4. Reflection Mechanisms:
- Extends Nova's validation with collective performance analysis
- Improves coordination patterns through shared insights
- Adapts group strategies based on reflection outcomes
- Enables continuous coordination optimization

5. Action Coordination:
- Enhances Nova's task execution with swarm-level synchronization

- Enables dynamic coordination pattern switching
- Optimizes concurrent operation handling

### Required Changes
Following files need updates to fully support swarm architectures:

1. src/nia/agents/base.py:
```python
class BaseAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        # Add swarm capabilities
        self.capabilities.update({
            "swarm": {
                "architectures": ["hierarchical", "parallel", "sequential", "mesh"],
                "types": ["MajorityVoting", "RoundRobin", "GraphWorkflow"],
                "roles": ["coordinator", "worker", "specialist"]
            }
        })
```

2. src/nia/agents/tinytroupe_agent.py:
```python
class TinyTroupeAgent:
    def _initialize_attributes(self):
        # Add swarm attributes
        self._configuration.update({
            "swarm_role": attributes.get("swarm_role", "worker"),
            "swarm_architecture": attributes.get("swarm_architecture", "hierarchical"),
            "swarm_type": attributes.get("swarm_type", "default")
        })
```

3. src/nia/agents/specialized/coordination_agent.py:
```python
class CoordinationAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        # Add swarm management
        self.swarm_architectures = {
            "hierarchical": self._handle_hierarchical_swarm,
            "parallel": self._handle_parallel_swarm,
            "sequential": self._handle_sequential_swarm,
            "mesh": self._handle_mesh_swarm
        }
```
