# 2025-01-03 Development Log

## Documentation Reorganization

### Documentation Consolidation ✓
- Consolidated all implementation details into README.md
- Created appendix.md for code examples and patterns
- Cleaned up docs directory
- Removed redundant documentation files

### Task Tracking System ✓
- Created comprehensive tasks.md
- Organized tasks by system components
- Added progress tracking
- Implemented daily updates section

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed Components ✓
- Core agent migration
- Memory system implementation
- Base Nova orchestrator
- Specialized agent implementations
- Basic FastAPI server setup

### In Progress
- FastAPI server enhancements
- Test failure fixes
- Frontend development preparation

### Test Failures to Address
1. test_coordinate_agents
   - Expected: 200
   - Actual: 422 (Unprocessable Entity)
   - Likely cause: Request validation issue

2. test_missing_api_key
   - Expected: 401 (Unauthorized)
   - Actual: 405 (Method Not Allowed)
   - Likely cause: Middleware order issue

3. test_rate_limiting
   - Expected: "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED"
   - Actual: "HTTP_ERROR"
   - Likely cause: Error code standardization needed

4. test_websocket
   - Error: APIKeyHeader.__call__() missing argument
   - Likely cause: Authentication middleware configuration

5. test_memory_operations
   - Error: Response validation error
   - Issue: Dictionary type mismatch in response

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. Fix test failures:
   - Review and update request validation
   - Fix authentication middleware
   - Standardize error codes
   - Update WebSocket authentication
   - Fix memory operation response format

2. FastAPI Enhancements:
   - Implement advanced error handling
   - Add comprehensive request validation
   - Update response formatting

3. Frontend Development:
   - Begin SvelteKit setup
   - Implement three-panel layout
   - Add WebSocket integration

### Technical Debt
- Need to standardize error responses
- Authentication middleware needs refactoring
- Response validation needs improvement
- WebSocket authentication needs enhancement

## Notes
- Documentation is now more maintainable
- Task tracking will help with daily progress
- Test failures indicate need for better validation
- Authentication system needs review

## Testing Strategy Update

### Interactive Agent Testing ✓
- Created agent_testing.ipynb for core agent verification
- Includes test scenarios for:
  * Memory system integration
  * Individual agent functionality
  * Multi-agent coordination
  * Domain awareness
  * Error handling

### Rationale
- Need to verify core functionality before proceeding with API fixes
- Interactive testing allows quick iteration and debugging
- Helps understand agent behavior patterns
- Validates memory system integration
- Ensures domain separation works correctly

### Next Testing Steps
1. Run notebook tests for core agents
2. Document behavior patterns and issues
3. Use findings to fix API endpoint tests
4. Implement proper error handling based on observations

## Implementation Progress

### Core Implementation ✓
- Created implementation.py with core system classes:
  * ConsolidationPattern and TinyTroupePattern for memory
  * EmergentTaskDetector for task discovery
  * TaskApprovalSystem for workflow management
  * CoordinationAgent for agent groups
  * ConversationLogger for tracing

### Testing Infrastructure ✓
- Updated agent_testing.ipynb with:
  * Proper imports from implementation.py
  * Memory system integration tests
  * Agent coordination tests
  * Domain awareness tests
  * Error handling scenarios

### Testing Strategy

#### Phase 1: Automated Tests ✓
Created run_tests.sh to execute tests in order:
1. Core Processing Agents
   * Parsing, Analysis, Validation, Schema
2. Cognitive Agents
   * Belief, Desire, Emotion, Reflection, Meta
3. Task Management
   * Task, Execution, Orchestration, Coordination
4. Communication
   * Dialogue, Response, Integration
5. System Operations
   * Monitoring, Alerting, Logging, Metrics, Analytics
6. Nova Core
   * Initialization, Orchestration, Coordination
7. Integration Tests
   * Full system integration, Server endpoints
8. Memory System
   * Two-layer memory, Consolidation

#### Phase 2: Interactive Testing
Use agent_testing.ipynb for:
* Debugging complex interactions
* Verifying memory patterns
* Testing domain separation
* Monitoring agent coordination
* Validating error handling

### Next Implementation Steps
1. Run automated tests:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/run_tests.sh
   ```

2. Fix failing tests:
   * API endpoint issues (422, 405 errors)
   * Authentication middleware
   * Rate limiting
   * WebSocket configuration
   * Memory operations

3. Run interactive notebook:
   * Debug any issues found in automated tests
   * Verify complex interactions
   * Document behavior patterns

4. Implement improvements:
   * Error handling
   * Request validation
   * Response formatting
   * Authentication flow
