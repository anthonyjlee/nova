## Collaborative Dialogue Implementation

### Dialogue Structure
1. Message Types
   ```python
   class DialogueMessage:
       agent_type: str  # Which agent sent it
       content: str    # Message content
       message_type: str  # question, answer, insight, etc.
       references: List[str]  # Referenced concepts
       metadata: Dict[str, Any]  # Additional context
   ```

2. Dialogue Context
   ```python
   class DialogueContext:
       topic: str  # Main discussion topic
       messages: List[DialogueMessage]  # Conversation flow
       participants: List[str]  # Participating agents
       status: str  # active, completed, etc.
   ```

### Agent Communication
1. Base Capabilities
   ```python
   # Send Message
   """Send dialogue message:
   - Regular message
   - Question
   - Insight
   - Response"""

   # Process Message
   """Handle incoming message:
   - Analyze content
   - Consider context
   - Generate response"""
   ```

2. Interaction Patterns
   ```python
   # Ask Question
   """Request information:
   - Specific query
   - Reference concepts
   - Track context"""

   # Provide Insight
   """Share understanding:
   - New observation
   - Pattern recognition
   - Relationship discovery"""
   ```

### MetaAgent Coordination
1. Dialogue Management
   ```python
   # Start Dialogue
   """Initialize discussion:
   - Set topic
   - Create context
   - Track participants"""

   # Guide Discussion
   """Coordinate interaction:
   - Ask questions
   - Request validation
   - Probe deeper
   - Synthesize insights"""
   ```

2. Action Types
   ```python
   # Dialogue Actions
   """Coordinate agents:
   ASK: Request information
   PROBE: Deeper analysis
   SYNTHESIZE: Combine insights
   VALIDATE: Check concepts
   CLARIFY: Request details"""
   ```

### Concept Validation
1. Collaborative Process
   - Concepts proposed by agents
   - Other agents validate/challenge
   - MetaAgent tracks consensus
   - Store only validated concepts

2. Validation Criteria
   ```python
   # Concept Validation
   """Check before storage:
   - Multiple agent support
   - Evidence quality
   - Contradiction check
   - Confidence threshold"""
   ```

### Key Improvements

1. Enhanced Interaction
   - Natural dialogue flow
   - Agent collaboration
   - Dynamic discussion
   - Better insights

2. Concept Quality
   - Validation through dialogue
   - Multiple perspectives
   - Better consensus
   - Cleaner knowledge graph

3. System Evolution
