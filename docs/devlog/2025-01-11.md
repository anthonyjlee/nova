# 2025-01-11 Development Log

## Work Done

1. Investigated and debugged issues with Neo4j graph initialization:
   - Added graph endpoints in `nova_endpoints.py` and `endpoints.py`
   - Created initialization scripts for test data
   - Identified issues with Neo4j database operations

2. Made several attempts to fix Neo4j issues:
   - Created test scripts to verify Neo4j connectivity
   - Modified Neo4j configuration to improve transaction handling:
     - Increased transaction timeout from 5s to 60s
     - Increased transaction memory limit
     - Added concurrent transaction settings
     - Added query optimization settings

## Current Blockers

1. Neo4j Database Issues:
   - Getting "NOT PART OF CHAIN" errors when trying to modify graph data
   - Unable to clear existing data or initialize new test data
   - Database seems to be in an inconsistent state

2. Graph Initialization:
   - Cannot properly initialize test data for agent-concept relationships
   - Need to resolve database state issues before proceeding with initialization

## Next Steps

1. Further investigate Neo4j database issues:
   - Consider checking Neo4j logs for more detailed error information
   - May need to explore database repair or recovery options
   - Consider testing with a completely fresh Neo4j instance

2. Once database issues are resolved:
   - Complete graph initialization with test data
   - Implement and test graph visualization features
   - Continue with agent team and coordination features

## Notes

- The Neo4j database seems to be having issues with relationship traversal
- Current configuration changes haven't fully resolved the issues
- May need to explore Neo4j version compatibility or known issues
