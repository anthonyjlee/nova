# 2025-01-11 Development Log

## Work Done

1. Investigated and debugged issues with Neo4j graph initialization:
   - Added graph endpoints in `nova_endpoints.py` and `endpoints.py`
   - Created initialization scripts for test data
   - Identified issues with Neo4j database operations

2. Made several attempts to fix Neo4j issues:
   - Created test scripts to verify Neo4j connectivity
   - Modified Neo4j configuration to improve transaction handling:
     - Increased transaction timeout from 5s to 60s
     - Increased transaction memory limit
     - Added concurrent transaction settings
     - Added query optimization settings

3. Successfully fixed Neo4j integration:
   - Fixed metadata serialization in agent_store.py to properly handle JSON strings
   - Added debug logging for metadata processing
   - Separated concept and agent initialization to prevent duplicates
   - Ensured proper relationship creation between concepts and agents
   - Verified graph structure shows:
     - 3 concept nodes with cyclic relationships
     - 4 agent nodes with proper metadata
     - 9 relationships (3 concept, 3 management, 3 coordination)
   - Confirmed frontend correctly displays the graph structure

## Current Status

1. Neo4j Integration:
   - Database operations working correctly
   - Metadata serialization/deserialization functioning properly
   - Graph visualization showing correct structure
   - Agent relationships properly established

2. Frontend:
   - Graph panel displaying all nodes and relationships
   - Agent list showing correct metadata
   - Need to debug chat panel functionality

## Next Steps

1. Debug chat panel:
   - Investigate POST /api/chat/threads/create 405 Method Not Allowed error
   - Check websocket connection handling
   - Review chat endpoints implementation

2. Once chat panel is working:
   - Test full agent communication flow
   - Implement remaining agent coordination features
   - Add additional visualization features

## Notes

- Successfully resolved Neo4j database issues through proper metadata handling and initialization separation
- Frontend graph visualization working as expected
- Need to focus on chat functionality next
