# 2024-12-20 Development Log

## Changes Made

1. Added JSONSerializable Protocol
- Created runtime checkable protocol for JSON serialization
- Added dict() method requirement for serializable objects
- Implemented on all memory system types

2. Enhanced DialogueContext
- Added created_at timestamp field
- Added participants set to track participating agents
- Updated add_message to maintain participants list
- Enhanced JSON serialization

3. Improved Base Agent
- Added support for string content in process method
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Improved type hints with Union[str, Dict]

4. Enhanced Content Parsing
- Improved regex patterns for content extraction
- Added support for JSON code blocks
- Enhanced concept extraction from text
- Added validation for parsed content

## Next Steps

1. Continue improving test coverage
2. Enhance error handling in agent responses
3. Add more robust content parsing strategies
4. Consider adding transaction support for dialogue operations

## Notes

The focus today was on improving the robustness of the memory system's core components, particularly around content parsing and dialogue management. The changes should make the system more reliable and easier to debug.

Key improvements:
- Better type safety with runtime checkable protocols
- More comprehensive dialogue context tracking
- More flexible content handling in agents
- Enhanced JSON serialization support

Still need to address:
- Memory consolidation issues
- Some failing tests around content extraction
- Meta agent synthesis edge cases
