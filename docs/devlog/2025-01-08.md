## Code Organization Improvements

### Docker Structure Reorganization
Improved Docker files organization for better maintainability:

1. Service-Specific Directories:
```
scripts/docker/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── neo4j/
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── neo4j.conf
│   └── apoc.conf
└── qdrant/
    └── Dockerfile
```

2. Updated paths in docker-compose.yml:
- Changed build contexts to use service directories
- Fixed volume paths to be relative to docker-compose.yml
- Simplified Dockerfile references

3. Updated manage.py to use new docker-compose.yml location

### Test Organization Improvements
Split TinyTroupe integration tests into focused files:

1. New Package Structure:
```
tests/tinytroupe_tests/
├── __init__.py
├── conftest.py
├── test_memory_basic.py
├── test_memory_consolidation.py
├── test_memory_domains.py
├── test_memory_lifecycle.py
├── test_memory_errors.py
└── test_world_nova_integration.py
```

2. Test Categories:
- Basic memory operations (store/query)
- Memory consolidation and pattern extraction
- Cross-domain memory access and validation
- Complete lifecycle and cleanup operations
- Error handling and edge cases
- World and Nova integration tests
- Shared fixtures in conftest.py

3. Memory Test Improvements:
- Better separation of concerns
- More focused test files
- Improved error handling coverage
- Shared fixtures to reduce duplication
- Clear test organization by functionality

### Architecture Understanding
After code review, clarified the system architecture:

1. Foundation Layer:
```
BaseAgent (Memory operations)
    ^
    |
TinyTroupeAgent (TinyPerson + Memory capabilities)
    ^
    |
Specialized Agents (Meta, Orchestration, etc.)
```

2. Domain Architecture:
- Access Domains (Privacy Boundaries):
  * "professional": Work-related memories
  * "personal": Personal/private memories
  * Controls data access and privacy
  * Strict separation with explicit cross-domain approval

- Knowledge Verticals (Subject Matter):
  * GENERAL: Cross-cutting or foundational knowledge
  * RETAIL: Retail industry knowledge
  * ECOMMERCE: E-commerce specific knowledge
  * PHILOSOPHY: Philosophical concepts and reasoning
  * PSYCHOLOGY: Psychological principles and behavior
  * BUSINESS: Business strategy and operations
  * SCIENCE: Scientific methods and findings
  * TECHNOLOGY: Technical and technological concepts
  * ARTS: Artistic and creative domains
  * EDUCATION: Educational theory and practice

3. TinyTroupe's Role:
- Provides memory system integration (episodic and semantic)
- Handles basic agent operations (store_memory, recall_memories, reflect)
- Manages configuration and attributes
- Supports domain boundaries and access control
- Provides emotion and concept learning capabilities

4. Cross-Domain Operations:
```python
context = {
    # Knowledge vertical
    "domain": Domain.PSYCHOLOGY,
    
    # Privacy boundary
    "access_domain": "professional",
    
    # Cross-domain access
    "cross_domain": {
        "requested": True,
        "approved": True,
        "justification": "Applying psychology to retail",
        "source_domain": Domain.PSYCHOLOGY,
        "target_domain": Domain.RETAIL
    }
}
```

5. Key Capabilities:
- Interdisciplinary knowledge combination
- Domain-specialized agent spawning
- Controlled knowledge transfer
- Privacy boundary enforcement
- Subject matter organization

6. Test Organization:
- Memory integration tests moved from tinytroupe_tests/ to memory/integration/
- Tests verify both privacy boundaries and knowledge verticals
- Cross-domain operations tested explicitly
- Interdisciplinary knowledge transfer validated
