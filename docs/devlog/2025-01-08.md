## Code Organization Improvements

### Docker Structure Reorganization
Improved Docker files organization for better maintainability:

1. Service-Specific Directories:
```
scripts/docker/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── neo4j/
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── neo4j.conf
│   └── apoc.conf
└── qdrant/
    └── Dockerfile
```

2. Updated paths in docker-compose.yml:
