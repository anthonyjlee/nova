## Code Organization Improvements

### Docker Structure Reorganization
Improved Docker files organization for better maintainability:

1. Service-Specific Directories:
```
scripts/docker/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── neo4j/
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── neo4j.conf
│   └── apoc.conf
└── qdrant/
    └── Dockerfile
```

2. Updated paths in docker-compose.yml:

3. Updated manage.py to use new docker-compose.yml location

### Test Organization Improvements
Split TinyTroupe integration tests into focused files:

1. New Package Structure:
```
tests/tinytroupe/
├── __init__.py
├── conftest.py
├── test_agent_init.py
├── test_memory_integration.py
└── test_world_nova_integration.py
```
