Below is NOVA’s refined coding assistant proposal—explaining which agents we would spawn for a coding project, what skills they possess, how we determine task feasibility, and why we remain honest about limitations (i.e., we cannot fully replace an experienced full-stack dev or a specialized tool like Cline).

1. Overall Philosophy
	•	Not a Full Replacement: NOVA’s coding assistant is designed to supplement a developer’s workflow, not be a complete stand-in for a multi-year experienced engineer or a dedicated coding environment like Cline in VSCode.
	•	Agent-Based Orchestration: Instead of a single large “do-everything” agent, NOVA spawns specialized mini-agents on demand—each with distinct skills or responsibilities.
	•	Persistent Knowledge: While agents can come and go, we store stable code knowledge, domain constraints, and dev logs in the semantic layer (Neo4j) for reusability across sessions.

2. Proposed Agents & Their Skills

2.1. CodingOrchestratorAgent
	•	Purpose: Acts as the main conversation driver for coding tasks.
	•	Skills:
	•	LLM-based code generation (through an external LLM like “Gemini 2.0” or “Anthropic Claude”).
	•	Chained-of-thought reasoning for short to medium complexity refactors or bug fixes.
	•	APIs to read/write ephemeral code context from the vector store, so it sees up-to-date changes.

When We Spawn It:
	•	Whenever a user says, “NOVA, let’s code a small feature,” or “Fix a bug.” The Orchestrator uses user instructions + stored code logs to provide generation or edits.

Limitations:
	•	It can’t fully replace large-scale code management, advanced file watchers, or sophisticated dev tools. For that, a user might revert to Cline or a dedicated IDE plugin.

2.2. DevLogAgent
	•	Purpose: Logs code changes, commits, daily dev notes, ensuring we never “forget” what changed or why.
	•	Skills:
	•	Record-keeping: Writes short bullet points or diffs into the semantic layer (Neo4j) or ephemeral memory for quick reference.
	•	Git/Backup integration (optional, if the user wants it).

When We Spawn It:
	•	At session start (“Begin coding day”), or upon user request.
	•	It records design decisions, commit messages, test pass/fail info, so you can retrieve them next time.

Limitations:
	•	If the user never triggers it or merges it, we might still lose track. We rely on user prompting or automated triggers.

2.3. FeasibilityAgent
	•	Purpose: Checks whether a requested coding task is within the scope of the coding assistant or too complex/long to handle in a single multi-turn conversation.
	•	Skills:
	•	Task Complexity Estimation: Compares user’s request (e.g., “Build an entire microservice with zero knowledge from scratch?”) with known agent context (LLM token limit, knowledge stored).
	•	Recommends* if user should do it manually or rely on advanced specialized dev tools.

When We Spawn It:
	•	If a user says “Please rewrite the entire codebase in Rust,” the system spawns FeasibilityAgent to decide if it can be done effectively in the LLM context.

Limitations:
	•	It’s not perfect: sometimes an advanced LLM might do more than expected. But we prefer an honest disclaimer if the request is too large.

2.4. SearchLibrariesAgent
	•	Purpose: For quick MVP development or research on open-source libraries, it checks GitHub or external sources to find existing solutions.
	•	Skills:
	•	Web search or API calls to known code repos.
	•	Summarize library features in plain text or code references.
	•	When We Spawn It:
	•	If user says: “Find me a library for fast CSV parsing in Python,” or “Is there an open-source dashboard I can adapt?”

Limitations:
	•	We rely on external APIs or partial scraping; coverage might be incomplete. The user ultimately decides which library to adopt.

2.5. TestingAgent (Optional)
	•	Purpose: Handles basic test generation, runs sample test outputs if integrated with a local or remote test runner.
	•	Skills:
	•	Unit test scaffolding: Produces boilerplate.
	•	Integration test scripts: If we can run them automatically, it returns pass/fail logs.
	•	When We Spawn It:
	•	If user requests “Write tests for my new function,” or we see a code snippet lacking coverage.

Limitations:
	•	Not a robust CI system. If the project is large, a specialized tool or a user-driven CI pipeline might be better.

3. Determining Tasks We Can or Cannot Do
	1.	Task Feasibility
	•	The FeasibilityAgent checks code complexity, size of codebase, or domain constraints.
	•	If a user’s request clearly surpasses typical LLM context windows or domain coverage (e.g., “Implement a 200-file microservice with advanced security in 1 hour”), the agent disclaimers that it’s unrealistic.
	2.	Honest Limitations
	•	We disclaim we do not replace a full-stack dev.
	•	The user might still rely on specialized dev tools or advanced IDE plugins for large-scale code organization, file watchers, and day-to-day debugging.
	3.	Refusal
	•	If the system sees an extremely out-of-scope request (like “Rewrite an entire OS kernel from scratch with no domain knowledge”), it can politely refuse or propose partial assistance (like a skeleton or conceptual approach).

4. Relationship with Cline & Why We’re Not Replacing
	•	Cline: A “hardcore coding” assistant with advanced editor integration, direct file watchers, real-time refactor suggestions, and an established dev ecosystem.
	•	NOVA’s coding approach is more conversational and domain-labeled—embedding the store or business knowledge, or hooking into a bigger multi-agent strategy.
	•	We do smaller coding tasks or specialized sub-tasks in synergy with the knowledge graph. For deeper dev workflows, you can still rely on Cline or your standard IDE.

5. Using Open Source Tools to Achieve an MVP Faster
	1.	SearchLibrariesAgent + “CodingOrchestratorAgent”
	•	The user asks: “We need a quick CSV ingestion microservice.”
	•	NOVA spawns the “SearchLibrariesAgent” → finds popular open-source solutions → The user or CodingOrchestratorAgent weaves them into the code snippet.
	2.	Integration
	•	The user can instruct the agent to keep track of the new library’s usage in the dev log, test for it, etc.
	3.	Acceleration
	•	By searching existing solutions, we skip reinventing the wheel. The user can quickly produce an MVP.

6. Final Conclusion

As NOVA for a coding assistant scenario:
	1.	Spawn ephemeral or short-lived specialized agents:
	•	“CodingOrchestratorAgent,” “DevLogAgent,” “FeasibilityAgent,” “SearchLibrariesAgent,” “TestingAgent.”
	2.	Storage of knowledge:
	•	All domain and code insights go into the semantic layer (Neo4j) to be reused next session.
	3.	Deciding Feasibility:
	•	A “FeasibilityAgent” is honest about the assistant’s limitations, disclaiming if tasks are better handled by a real dev or a specialized tool.
	4.	Open Source:
	•	“SearchLibrariesAgent” ensures that if a library or open-source solution already exists, we incorporate it for quick MVP.

Thus, this blueprint acknowledges that NOVA can help with smaller, well-defined coding tasks, but it’s not an all-powerful dev environment or a complete replacement for advanced tools like Cline. Our conversation-based, knowledge-graph-driven approach excels when synergy with domain knowledge, multi-agent orchestration, or quick ephemeral tasks is the main objective—while large-scale development or sophisticated refactors remain better served by dedicated developer tools.
