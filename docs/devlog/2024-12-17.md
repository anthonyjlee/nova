# Development Log - December 17, 2024

## Major Changes

### Memory System Types
- Added comprehensive type definitions in `memory_types.py`
- Added `Evolution` class for tracking changes over time
- Added `Capability` class for system features
- Added `RelationshipTypes` enum for semantic relationships
- Added relationships field to all major classes
- Added JSON serialization support for all types

### Agent Architecture
- Created new `ParsingAgent` for LLM-based text parsing
- Removed regex-based parsing in favor of LLM methods
- Updated `MetaAgent` to use `ParsingAgent` for structured data extraction
- Made prompts focus on natural language understanding
- Added multi-step LLM processing for better extraction

### Code Quality
- Fixed circular imports with abstract interfaces
- Added proper type hints and documentation
- Improved error handling and logging
- Made JSON serialization more robust
- Added validation fields to all concepts

## Design Decisions

### Moving Away from Regex
- Previously used regex patterns to parse structured data
- This was brittle and required constant maintenance
- Switched to using LLMs for parsing which is more flexible
- ParsingAgent can understand both explicit and implicit structure

### Agent-Based Parsing
- Created dedicated ParsingAgent for text understanding
- Uses multi-step LLM processing:
  1. Initial analysis of text
  2. Structured data extraction
  3. Concept and relationship mapping
- Better handles complex relationships and validation

### Type System
- Added Evolution tracking to all major types
- Added semantic relationships between concepts
- Made all types JSON serializable
- Added validation tracking to concepts

## Next Steps

### Testing
- Complete dialogue flow tests
- Add tests for new type system
- Test multi-step LLM parsing
- Verify relationship handling

### Documentation
- Document new type system
- Add examples of LLM-based parsing
- Update architecture docs
- Add validation guidelines

### Features
- Implement relationship visualization
- Add evolution tracking UI
- Enhance validation system
- Improve dialogue synthesis
