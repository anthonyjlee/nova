## Refactoring and Code Organization

### Centralized Agent Prompts
- Moved all agent prompts to a centralized `prompts.py` file
- Updated all agents to use the centralized prompts:
  - belief_agent.py
  - desire_agent.py
  - emotion_agent.py
  - reflection_agent.py
  - research_agent.py
  - task_planner_agent.py
  - task_agent.py
  - dialogue_agent.py
  - context_agent.py
  - structure_agent.py
  - response_processor.py
- Added specialized prompts for:
  - Structure validation
  - Schema validation
  - Schema extraction

### UI Reorganization
- Renamed mobile.py to gradio.py to better reflect its purpose as the Gradio interface
- Moved all test files to tests/ui/ directory for better organization
- Removed unused files:
  - desktop.py (focusing on Gradio interface)
  - test_command.py
  - test_minimal.py
- Cleaned up UI directory structure:
  ```
  src/nia/ui/
  â”œâ”€â”€ assets/         # UI assets (SVGs)
  â”œâ”€â”€ gradio.py      # Main Gradio interface
  â”œâ”€â”€ handlers.py    # Request handlers
  â”œâ”€â”€ main.py        # Entry point
  â”œâ”€â”€ messenger.py   # Messaging utilities
  â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt
  ```

### Enhanced Dialogue System
- Added natural language dialogue synthesis to meta agent
- Updated meta agent prompt to integrate perspectives from all agents into a cohesive voice
- Added theory of mind capabilities:
  - Acknowledges and responds to user's emotional state
  - Shows understanding of user's beliefs and knowledge
  - Recognizes user's goals and intentions
  - Adapts response style to match context
  - Maintains consistent personality while integrating all agent perspectives
- Added "whispers" feature to show internal agent dialogue:
  - Emotion agent shares emotional observations
  - Belief agent contributes key insights
  - Desire agent reveals perceived motivations
  - Reflection agent notes relevant patterns
  - Research agent adds contextual knowledge
  - Makes the multi-agent system more transparent and engaging
- Modified AgentResponse to include separate fields for:
  - response: Direct, concise answer
  - dialogue: Natural, conversational response that integrates all agent perspectives
  - whispers: Internal dialogue between agents showing their individual perspectives

### Enhanced Gradio UI with Memory Integration
- Added message metadata support in orchestration view:
  - "ðŸ§  Thinking" messages show when Nova is processing
  - "ðŸ¤« Whisper" messages show agent internal dialogue
  - "ðŸ’­ Agent" messages show each agent's contributions
- Added rich visualization components:
  - gr.HighlightedText for active agents and key concepts
  - gr.Plot for memory distribution and agent network visualization
  - gr.Gallery for concept visualizations
  - gr.Accordion for organized, collapsible sections
- Integrated memory systems with UI state:
  - Episodic Memory:
    - Tracks conversation history and context
    - Stores user interaction patterns
    - Maintains UI preferences across sessions
  - Semantic Memory:
    - Powers concept network visualization
    - Provides enriched concept information
    - Generates concept visualizations
  - Neo4j Integration:
    - Drives graph visualization preferences
    - Stores useful Cypher queries
    - Manages node styling and filters
- Added Knowledge Graph visualization tab:
  - Interactive graph view using Cytoscape.js
  - Cypher query interface for exploring Neo4j data
  - Graph controls for different layouts
  - Node details panel for inspecting properties
- Makes the multi-agent orchestration more transparent and engaging
- Creates a seamless connection between UI state and memory systems

### Future Plans
- Gradio interface will serve as API layer for future React/Next.js frontend
- This separation will allow for more flexible and modern UI development while maintaining stable API endpoints
- Enhanced dialogue system will provide more natural and contextually aware interactions
- Continue exploring Gradio's features for richer UI interactions
