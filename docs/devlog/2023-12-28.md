## Refactoring and Code Organization

### Centralized Agent Prompts
- Moved all agent prompts to a centralized `prompts.py` file
- Updated all agents to use the centralized prompts:
  - belief_agent.py
  - desire_agent.py
  - emotion_agent.py
  - reflection_agent.py
  - research_agent.py
  - task_planner_agent.py
  - task_agent.py
  - dialogue_agent.py
  - context_agent.py
  - structure_agent.py
  - response_processor.py
- Added specialized prompts for:
  - Structure validation
  - Schema validation
  - Schema extraction

### UI Reorganization
- Renamed mobile.py to gradio.py to better reflect its purpose as the Gradio interface
- Moved all test files to tests/ui/ directory for better organization
- Removed unused files:
  - desktop.py (focusing on Gradio interface)
  - test_command.py
  - test_minimal.py
- Cleaned up UI directory structure:
  ```
  src/nia/ui/
  ├── assets/         # UI assets (SVGs)
  ├── gradio.py      # Main Gradio interface
  ├── handlers.py    # Request handlers
  ├── main.py        # Entry point
  ├── messenger.py   # Messaging utilities
  └── requirements.txt
  ```

### Enhanced Dialogue System
- Added natural language dialogue synthesis to meta agent
- Updated meta agent prompt to integrate perspectives from all agents into a cohesive voice
- Added theory of mind capabilities:
  - Acknowledges and responds to user's emotional state
  - Shows understanding of user's beliefs and knowledge
  - Recognizes user's goals and intentions
  - Adapts response style to match context
  - Maintains consistent personality while integrating all agent perspectives
- Modified AgentResponse to include separate fields for:
  - response: Direct, concise answer
  - dialogue: Natural, conversational response that integrates all agent perspectives

### Future Plans
- Gradio interface will serve as API layer for future React/Next.js frontend
- This separation will allow for more flexible and modern UI development while maintaining stable API endpoints
- Enhanced dialogue system will provide more natural and contextually aware interactions
