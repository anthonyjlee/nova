## Added New UI System

Created a new Gradio-based UI system with three main components:

### 1. System-1 (Real-time)
- Implemented real-time computer interaction interface
- Added API key management
- Integrated with Anthropic's computer use capabilities
- Added screenshot display and command execution

### 2. System-2 (Nova/Agents)
- Created WhatsApp-style messenger interface
- Added pinned Nova group chat
- Implemented individual agent chats
- Added session data visualization
- Integrated debugging information display
- Real-time chat updates and history

### 3. Memory System
- Added Neo4j graph visualization
- Implemented query interface with quick filters
- Added memory browsing capabilities
- Integrated concept relationship visualization
- Added real-time memory statistics

## Technical Details

### UI Architecture
- Created modular UI system with separate handlers for each component
- Implemented event handling for all UI interactions
- Added proper error handling and logging
- Integrated with existing Neo4j store

### Code Organization
- Created new `ui` package with:
  - `app.py`: Main UI application
  - `handlers.py`: Event handlers for each component
  - `main.py`: Entry point with dependency checks
  - Proper package structure with `__init__.py`

### Dependencies
- Added Gradio for UI components
- Integrated NetworkX and Matplotlib for graph visualization
- Added Anthropic client for System-1
- Proper environment variable handling

### Error Handling
- Added comprehensive error checking
- Improved logging throughout the system
- Added dependency verification
- Added environment checks for Neo4j and API keys

## Next Steps
1. Implement real-time command execution in System-1
2. Add agent response logic in System-2
3. Implement custom query execution in Memory System
4. Add more visualization options for memory graphs
5. Improve error recovery and system stability
