## Interface Redesign Progress

Today we made significant progress on the interface redesign, focusing on two major components:

### 1. Task Management Interface

Completed the Slack-like redesign of the task management interface while maintaining the DAG structure internally:

- Converted TaskBoard to Kanban layout with 4 columns (Pending, In Progress, Blocked, Completed)
- Added TaskDetails panel with state transitions
- Implemented drag-and-drop between columns
- Added lifecycle management for performance tracking
- Updated task state transitions in backend
- Added validation for state changes
- Added episodic memory tracking for transitions

### 2. Knowledge Graph Interface

Integrated the existing Cytoscape-based graph visualization for the Knowledge tab:

- Created dedicated knowledge page route
- Reused existing GraphPanel component with Cytoscape visualization
- Maintained real-time updates through WebSocket connection
- Preserved domain labeling and filtering
- Kept relationship visualization with interactive controls
- Retained node/relationship management capabilities

### 3. Performance Improvements

#### Component Lifecycle Management
- Added memory leak detection
- Added resource tracking
- Added performance metrics collection
- Added compute time tracking
- Added error tracking

#### State Management
- Added validation for state transitions
- Added domain access validation
- Added dependency validation
- Added error handling with retries

### 4. Data Flow

1. Task Management:
   - Task starts in 'pending' state
   - Stored in semantic layer with metadata
   - Appears in Pending column
   - User can drag between columns
   - Backend validates transitions
   - Updates semantic layer
   - Records in episodic memory

2. Knowledge Graph:
   - Nodes represent concepts/entities
   - Real-time updates from conversations
   - Domain-based filtering
   - Interactive visualization
   - Relationship management
   - Performance-optimized rendering

### 5. Next Steps

1. Monitor Performance:
   - Track component lifecycle metrics
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Track state transition times
   - Analyze error patterns

2. UI Improvements:
   - Add transition animations
   - Improve error messages
   - Add loading states
   - Add keyboard shortcuts

3. Backend Optimizations:
   - Cache frequent queries
   - Batch updates
   - Optimize state transitions
   - Improve validation speed

4. Testing:
   - Add performance tests
   - Add state transition tests
   - Add error handling tests
   - Add lifecycle tests

The redesign maintains the power of the DAG structure while providing more intuitive interfaces for both task management and knowledge exploration. The addition of lifecycle management and performance tracking will help identify and resolve issues quickly.
