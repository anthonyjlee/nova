## Task Management Interface Redesign

Today we completed the Slack-like redesign of the task management interface while maintaining the DAG structure internally. The changes span both frontend and backend components.

### 1. Frontend Components

#### TaskBoard Component
- Converted from graph visualization to Kanban board layout
- Added four columns: Pending, In Progress, Blocked, Completed
- Implemented drag-and-drop between columns
- Added TaskDetails panel integration
- Added lifecycle management for performance tracking

#### TaskColumn Component
- Updated to match new task states
- Added drag-and-drop handlers
- Added performance tracking for scroll operations
- Added error handling with metrics

#### TaskCard Component
- Updated to use new task states
- Added lifecycle management
- Added performance tracking for date formatting
- Added resource tracking for drag operations
- Improved error handling

#### TaskDetails Panel
- Added state transition buttons
- Added sub-tasks with checkboxes
- Added comments section
- Added dependency view
- Added performance tracking
- Added resource cleanup

### 2. Backend Changes

#### Task State Management
- Updated valid state transitions:
  * Pending → In Progress
  * In Progress → Blocked/Completed
  * Blocked → In Progress
  * Completed (no transitions)
- Added validation for state transitions
- Added dependency checks for blocked state

#### API Endpoints
- Updated `/api/tasks/board` for Kanban view
- Added `/api/tasks/{id}/transition` for state changes
- Maintained DAG structure in backend
- Added episodic memory tracking for transitions

### 3. Performance Improvements

#### Component Lifecycle Management
- Added memory leak detection
- Added resource tracking
- Added performance metrics collection
- Added compute time tracking
- Added error tracking

#### State Management
- Added validation for state transitions
- Added domain access validation
- Added dependency validation
- Added error handling with retries

### 4. Data Flow

1. Task Creation:
   - Task starts in 'pending' state
   - Stored in semantic layer with metadata
   - Appears in Pending column

2. Task Transitions:
   - User drags task to new column
   - Frontend validates move
   - Backend validates state transition
   - Updates semantic layer
   - Records transition in episodic memory

3. Task Dependencies:
   - Maintained in semantic layer
   - Validated during state transitions
   - Required for blocking tasks
   - Visible in task details

### 5. Next Steps

1. Monitor Performance:
   - Track component lifecycle metrics
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Track state transition times
   - Analyze error patterns

2. UI Improvements:
   - Add transition animations
   - Improve error messages
   - Add loading states
   - Add keyboard shortcuts

3. Backend Optimizations:
   - Cache frequent queries
   - Batch updates
   - Optimize state transitions
   - Improve validation speed

4. Testing:
   - Add performance tests
   - Add state transition tests
   - Add error handling tests
   - Add lifecycle tests

The redesign maintains the power of the DAG structure while providing a more intuitive Kanban interface for users. The addition of lifecycle management and performance tracking will help identify and resolve issues quickly.
