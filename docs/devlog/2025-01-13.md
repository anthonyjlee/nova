## Interface Redesign Progress

Today we made progress on the interface redesign and identified key backend integration needs:

### 1. Task Management Interface

Completed the Slack-like redesign of the task management interface while maintaining the DAG structure internally:

- Converted TaskBoard to Kanban layout with 4 columns (Pending, In Progress, Blocked, Completed)
- Added TaskDetails panel with state transitions
- Implemented drag-and-drop between columns
- Added lifecycle management for performance tracking

### 2. Knowledge Graph Interface

Integrated the existing Cytoscape-based graph visualization for the Knowledge tab:

- Created dedicated knowledge page route
- Reused existing GraphPanel component with Cytoscape visualization
- Maintained real-time updates through WebSocket connection
- Preserved domain labeling and filtering

### 3. Three-Panel Layout Integration

Verified and enhanced the existing three-panel layout:

#### Left Navigation Panel
- Main Channels (NOVA main, team sub-channels)
- Direct Messages with agents
- Section navigation (Tasks, Agents, Knowledge)
- Search functionality
- Workspace/domain controls

#### Center Panel (Context-Aware)
- Chat interface for channels/DMs
- Task board for task management
- Agent view for team visualization
- Knowledge graph for concept exploration

#### Right Panel (Details)
- Channel/DM details
- Task details and actions
- Agent/team information
- Node/concept properties

### 4. Backend Implementation Progress

#### 4.1 Channel/DM System (Completed)
Implemented endpoints:
```typescript
// Channel Management
GET /api/channels/{id}/details      // Channel info, description, created date
GET /api/channels/{id}/members      // Member list with status and roles
GET /api/channels/{id}/pinned       // Pinned messages and items
POST /api/channels/{id}/settings    // Update notification/privacy settings

// Agent DM Management
GET /api/agents/{id}/details        // Agent info, type, capabilities
GET /api/agents/{id}/metrics        // Performance and response metrics
GET /api/agents/{id}/interactions   // Recent conversation history with context
```

#### 4.2 Task Management (Completed)
Added new endpoints:
```typescript
// Task Management
POST /api/tasks/{id}/subtasks       // Add subtask to task
POST /api/tasks/{id}/comments       // Add comment to task
```

#### 4.3 Knowledge Graph (Completed)
Added cross-domain endpoints:
```typescript
// Knowledge Graph
POST /api/kg/crossDomain           // Request cross-domain access
GET /api/kg/domains                // List available domains
POST /api/kg/taskReference         // Link task to concept
GET /api/kg/taskConcepts           // Get task-related concepts
```

#### 4.4 Memory Layer Integration
Implemented two-layer system:
- Episodic Layer (Qdrant):
  * Recent changes stored in episodic memory
  * Chat history with metadata
  * Short-term context tracking
  * Task state transitions
- Semantic Layer (Neo4j):
  * Long-term relationships
  * Task references and dependencies
  * Cross-domain knowledge management
  * Team structures and hierarchies

### 5. WebSocket Implementation (Completed)

#### 5.1 WebSocket Server
Implemented WebSocket server with connection management:
```python
# Connection types
- chat: Channel/DM message updates
- tasks: Task board state changes
- agents: Agent status updates
- graph: Knowledge graph modifications

# Features
- Connection management per type
- Real-time broadcasting
- Automatic reconnection handling
- Domain-aware message routing
```

#### 5.2 Memory Integration
Connected WebSocket system to two-layer memory:
```python
# Episodic Layer (Qdrant)
- Real-time message storage
- Task state transitions
- Agent status updates
- Graph modifications

# Semantic Layer (Neo4j)
- Task state persistence
- Agent status tracking
- Graph structure updates
- Cross-domain relationships
```

#### 5.3 Event Types
Implemented event handlers for:
```typescript
// Message Events
- New messages
- Message updates
- Thread changes

// Task Events
- State transitions
- Assignment changes
- Comment/subtask updates

// Agent Events
- Status changes
- Team updates
- Performance metrics

// Graph Events
- Node updates
- Edge modifications
- Domain changes
```

### 6. Frontend WebSocket Integration (In Progress)
