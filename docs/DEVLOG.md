# Development Log

## 2024-12-16

### Initial Implementation
- Set up project structure with proper Python packaging
- Implemented core memory system with Qdrant vector store
- Created agent system with specialized agents
- Added interactive CLI for testing

### Memory System Implementation
- Implemented two-layer memory architecture
- Added vector-based storage with semantic search
- Created indexed fields for efficient retrieval:
  - memory_type (keyword)
  - timestamp (keyword)
  - importance (float)

### Agent System Development
- Implemented base agent with vector similarity
- Created specialized agents:
  - BeliefAgent
  - DesireAgent
  - EmotionAgent
  - ReflectionAgent
  - ResearchAgent
  - MetaAgent

### Repository Organization
- Set up proper git repository structure
- Added comprehensive documentation
- Configured .gitignore for Python development
- Removed unnecessary files and directories
- Added basic test framework

### Memory System Refactoring
- Integrated LMStudio for both completions and embeddings:
  - Replaced sentence-transformers with LMStudio embeddings API
  - Added LMStudio chat completions for agent responses
  - Configured Nomic embed model for semantic search
- Fixed Neo4j query issues:
  - Corrected ORDER BY clauses in memory search
  - Fixed aggregation issues in capabilities query
  - Improved relationship handling
- Enhanced agent response handling:
  - Added proper conversion from LLM responses to agent responses
  - Improved error handling and retries
  - Added structured JSON validation
- Updated system prompts:
  - Made responses more natural and conversational
  - Maintained analytical depth while improving engagement
  - Added better context handling
- Consolidated example code:
  - Moved core functionality to main.py
  - Removed redundant example files
  - Improved code organization

### Next Steps
