## 2024-12-09: Memory System Overhaul

### Major Changes
- Implemented two-layer memory system:
  - Short-term memory (in-memory):
    - Episodic memories: Recent experiences and interactions
    - Semantic memories: Processed knowledge and understanding
  - Long-term memory (Qdrant):
    - Vector-based storage for semantic search
    - All memories eventually move here
    - Maintains metadata for filtering

### Technical Improvements
- Added Qdrant vector store integration
- Implemented semantic embeddings using local API
- Enhanced agent memory access:
  - Direct access to both memory layers
  - Proper async/await handling
  - Better memory context integration
- Improved memory synthesis:
  - Semantic similarity weighting
  - Context-aware prompts
  - Better memory retrieval
- Added structured capability analysis:
  - Detailed capability tracking
  - Development progress monitoring
  - Opportunity assessment
  - Challenge identification

### Architecture Updates
- Memory Store:
  - Manages both short-term and long-term storage
  - Handles memory transitions between layers
  - Provides unified memory access interface
- Base Agent:
  - Enhanced memory access methods
  - Better error handling
  - Improved async support
- Meta Agent:
  - Enhanced semantic synthesis
  - Better memory integration
  - Improved context handling

### Next Steps
- Monitor memory system performance
- Fine-tune semantic search parameters
- Optimize memory transition strategies
- Enhance memory consolidation process
- Improve memory retrieval relevance
