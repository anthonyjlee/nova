### Enhanced Parsing System with StructureAgent

Major improvements to the parsing and structure analysis system:

1. Added StructureAgent
- Specialized agent for complex data structure analysis
- Schema validation and extraction capabilities
- Hierarchical relationship mapping
- Validation rules and constraints handling

2. Enhanced ParsingAgent
- Added StructureAgent integration as fallback strategy
- Improved error handling and validation
- Enhanced JSON cleaning and extraction
- Added confidence scoring based on content quality

3. Updated Memory System
- Integrated StructureAgent into processing pipeline
- Added structure analysis to memory consolidation
- Enhanced documentation with new agent architecture
- Improved error handling and logging

4. Architecture Improvements
- Separated parsing concerns between agents
- Added validation for complex data structures
- Enhanced schema handling capabilities
- Improved error recovery strategies

These changes should significantly improve the system's ability to handle complex data structures and reduce parsing errors.

### Centralized Parsing and Error Handling

Major refactoring of agent system to improve reliability and maintainability:

1. Centralized Response Parsing
- Updated all agents to use the base agent's implementation that leverages the parsing agent
- Removed duplicate parsing logic from individual agents
- Standardized JSON response handling across the system

2. Enhanced ParsingAgent
- Added multiple fallback strategies for JSON parsing
- Improved error handling and validation
- Added comprehensive logging for better debugging
- Enhanced JSON cleaning and extraction functionality
- Added validation for all response fields
- Implemented confidence scoring based on content quality

3. Updated Agents:
- BeliefAgent: Simplified to use centralized parsing
- DesireAgent: Removed custom response processing
- EmotionAgent: Streamlined implementation
- ReflectionAgent: Updated to use base parsing
- TaskPlannerAgent: Enhanced with standardized response format
- DialogueAgent: Improved dialogue management with robust parsing
- ResponseProcessor: Merged functionality into ParsingAgent
- ContextBuilder: Updated to handle AgentResponse format

4. Error Reduction Strategies:
- Added input validation across all parsing functions
- Implemented multiple parsing strategies with graceful fallbacks
- Enhanced JSON cleaning with comprehensive regex patterns
- Added field validation and type checking
- Improved error logging for debugging
- Standardized error response formats

These changes should significantly reduce parsing errors and improve the overall reliability of the agent system.
