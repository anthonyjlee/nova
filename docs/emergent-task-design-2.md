Below is a fully rewritten proposal that explicitly captures the multi-phase process of creating an agent solution (i.e., an “agent team”), how research and planning occur before final confirmation, how the user (conversing with Nova in the main channel) can re-iterate or discard partial designs, and where specialized tasks or sub-agents come into play. We’ll also be very specific about the UI/UX flow, endpoints, and how they tie together in a Slack-like environment with multi-phase steps.

1. High-Level Overview
	1.	Phases of Agent Solution Creation:
	•	(A) Research & Understanding: user and Nova discuss intent/purpose, gather relevant domain data, define specialized agent roles, ask for new “skills” if needed.
	•	(B) Planning & Design: user plus Nova produce a final blueprint for the agent solution (i.e., how many agents, roles, input/output definitions).
	•	(C) Confirmation: user explicitly approves (“Yes, spawn the agent team now”), at which point a new channel/thread is formed to host that agent solution in action.
	•	(D) Execution: the agent team runs, possibly spawning sub-tasks. The user can talk to them, or if incorrect, revert to Nova in the main channel and “respawn” a new solution design.
	•	(E) Possibly Additional Tasks discovered mid-execution, each triggered by the user or the agent solution.
	2.	Key Distinction:
	•	Agents aren’t instantly spawned just from a single user message. Instead, the user and Nova have a conversation to refine the design.
	•	Only after final confirmation do we spin up the agent team in a new channel/thread.
	3.	Slack-Like UI + Backend (NOVA + specialized endpoints) means we have:
	•	A main channel with Nova: “General” or “NOVA HQ.”
	•	A final “Agent Team Channel” (or sub-thread) once the solution is spawned.
	•	Endpoints to handle each multi-phase step, from design to spawn to re-iteration.

2. Detailed Multi-Phase Flow

2.1. Phase A: Research & Understanding
	1.	User opens the main “NOVA” channel.
	2.	User says: “We want an agent solution to simulate 100 shoppers.”
	•	Nova doesn’t spawn them immediately. Instead, it triggers a “research and scope” conversation.
	3.	Nova might ask clarifying Qs:
	•	“Are these 100 shoppers realistic or synthetic? Do we have existing data references? What domain do we integrate?”
	4.	Specialized Sub-Agents for research:
	•	Possibly a “ResearchScoutAgent” or “FeasibilityAgent” is used within the main channel or a small sub-thread for fact-finding.
	•	The user and Nova refine exactly what they want.

UI/UX:
	•	The user sees each step in the same “NOVA” main channel or a sub-thread labeled “Research #1” if a dedicated thread is preferred.
	•	No final solution is formed yet. The user can do multiple messages back-and-forth to finalize the requirement.

Endpoints (sample):
	•	POST /api/conversations/{channelId}/messages – user -> Nova
	•	Nova uses a “spawn ephemeral agent” internally or sub-thread if needed. No permanent channel is formed yet.

2.2. Phase B: Planning & Design
	1.	User & Nova refine the blueprint:
	•	“We’ll have 100 ephemeral shopper agents, each referencing X data or skill. We also need a ‘CoordinatorAgent’ to unify them. Input is the store leftover dataset. Output is a summary of shopper behaviors.”
	2.	Nova might propose specialized roles: “ShopperAgent,” “CoordinatorAgent,” “AnalysisAgent” to handle final results.
	3.	User iterates: “Yes, but also give them some markdown strategy or we need a new skill to handle the time-of-day logic.”
	4.	End with a final plan, e.g.:
	“We’ll spawn 100 ‘ShopperAgent’ with the ‘time-of-day’ skill, 1 ‘CoordinatorAgent’ in a new channel. They produce a synthetic simulation log as the final output.”

UI/UX:
	•	Still in the same channel, “NOVA HQ.”
	•	Possibly a message or “Plan Summary” JSON is rendered:

{
  "agent_team": {
    "ShopperAgent_count": 100,
    "CoordinatorAgent": 1,
    "skills_required": ["time-of-day", "markdown_strategy"],
    "input_data": "store leftover dataset",
    "output_expectation": "simulation log"
  }
}


	•	The user can keep adjusting until satisfied.

Endpoints:
	•	POST /api/designSession or a series of messages to the main channel describing the design. Nova collects these design specs in ephemeral memory or a design-based route.

2.3. Phase C: Confirmation (User Approves Start)
	1.	User sees: “Nova, here’s the final plan. Are we ready?”
	2.	Nova returns a short confirmation message: “Confirm you want to spawn a new agent solution named ‘ShopperSim #001’ with 100 shopper agents + 1 coordinator. Type Yes, confirm.”
	3.	User says: “Yes, confirm.”
	4.	Nova then spawns the agent solution—creating a new channel or sub-thread for them to operate in, e.g. “Channel: ShopperSim #001.”

UI/UX:
	•	The user clicks or types “Yes, confirm.”
	•	Immediately the UI sees a new channel “ShopperSim #001” in the left sidebar or a new thread. Possibly a system message “Spawned 101 ephemeral agents.”

Endpoints:
	•	POST /api/projects or POST /api/spawnSolution with the final design spec.
	•	The backend responds with a new channel ID or thread ID.

2.4. Phase D: Execution in the Agent Team Channel/Thread
	1.	New Channel: “ShopperSim #001.”
	2.	All 100 ShopperAgents + 1 Coordinator exist logically, but for practical UI, we do the following:
	•	If fewer than 10, we might show each agent with an avatar.
	•	If more than 10, we group them under a single “Agent Team” heading to avoid flooding the user’s chat.
	3.	User can chat with the entire team or mention the “CoordinatorAgent.”
	4.	If the user wants to see an individual shopper agent’s logs, they can click “Expand Agents” or some similar UI approach.

Sub-Tasks:
	•	The team might detect sub-tasks mid-execution (like “We need an ‘AnalysisAgent’ to interpret leftover produce data.”).
	•	The user sees ephemeral messages in the channel if it’s important. If it’s minimal, they remain hidden or grouped.

Pause/Stop:
	•	The user can “Pause Execution” or “Stop” the entire team in the channel.
	•	Nova updates the states to “paused” or “canceled.”

UI/UX:
	•	A “Control Panel” in “ShopperSim #001” with Start/Stop/Pause.
	•	A “Sub-task log” or “DAG view” if the user wants to see the chain of ephemeral tasks or sub-agents inside the team.

Endpoints:
	•	POST /api/projects/{id}/start / pause / stop
	•	Possibly GET /api/teams/{id}/agents to list or hide agents.

2.5. If It’s Incorrect (Respawn / Re-Design)
	1.	User sees after some attempts: “Wait, we needed 200 shopper agents, not 100,” or “We forgot we need BFSI disclaimers.”
	2.	User returns to “NOVA HQ” main channel: “@Nova, we want to discard or re-do the design. Let’s do a new planning iteration.”
	3.	Nova either stops or kills the current agent solution.
	4.	They do a fresh iteration of (A) research, (B) planning, (C) confirmation, leading to a new channel or thread for the new approach.

UI/UX:
	•	The user sees the old agent solution channel remain for record, but the tasks are canceled.
	•	A brand-new channel might be created after the user’s new design is confirmed.

3. “Detecting Tasks” & Dialogue with Agents During Execution
	1.	Detecting Tasks:
	•	If the “CoordinatorAgent” notices a new sub-task is needed, it might mention in the agent team channel: “We need to parse a large leftover dataset, let’s spawn a ‘DataParsingAgent.’”
	•	The user can confirm or quickly say “Ok, do it,” or “No, let me check first.”
	2.	Speak to the Sub-Task:
	•	The user can address that sub-agent in the same channel or open a mini sub-thread.
	•	Typically, “@CoordinatorAgent, let’s be sure about the data fields. Summon ‘DataParsingAgent’ only if we have the correct CSV.”
	3.	UI:
	•	Slack-like mentions, ephemeral or pinned sub-threads for each sub-agent if the user wants.
	•	Or hide them if we have too many.

4. Defining “Done” & Output
	1.	User & Nova define “done” criteria in the planning phase:
	•	e.g. “We’re done when 100 shopper agents produce a final summary with leftover purchases.”
	•	or “We’re done once BFSI compliance doc is generated.”
	2.	UI:
	•	The agent team channel eventually posts a “Final Output” structured JSON or file.
	•	The user can see it as a pinned message or attachment.
	•	Agents finalize the state to “Completed.”
	3.	Backend:
	•	The orchestrator sets the project’s final status to “done,” ephemeral agents are dissolved, or remain in “archived” mode.

5. Technical Endpoints & Flows

Below is a refined breakdown, combining all steps:
	1.	(A) Research & Understanding:
	•	POST /api/conversations/{mainChannelId}/messages – user to Nova
	•	Nova orchestrates ephemeral sub-agents if needed, but no permanent channel spawn yet.
	2.	(B) Planning & Design:
	•	Possibly POST /api/design to store the iterative design specs.
	•	All conversation logs remain in main channel or ephemeral memory.
	•	No final spawn yet.
	3.	(C) Confirmation:
	•	POST /api/spawnSolution – user passes the design blueprint or references the design ID.
	•	The system returns a new channel ID or sub-thread ID, e.g. “Team #xyz.”
	4.	(D) Execution:
	•	POST /api/projects/{id}/start (or automatically starts if so configured).
	•	Agents communicate in POST /api/conversations/{teamChannelId}/messages.
	•	If the user calls “/pause,” “/stop,” these map to POST /api/projects/{id}/pause or stop.
	5.	Re-Design:
	•	If user discards the current solution, POST /api/projects/{id}/stop or “discard.”
	•	Returns to main channel, does “/api/design” again to create new blueprint.

6. UI/UX Implementation Notes
	1.	Main Channel: “NOVA HQ”
	•	A chat feed, user sees new ephemeral messages from Nova or minor sub-agents.
	•	“Stages” are ephemeral: from research to planning.
	2.	Design Overlays:
	•	Possibly a side panel or ephemeral messages that summarise “The design so far: #Agents=100, Skills=…”
	•	The user can click “Approve” or keep editing.
	3.	After Confirmation:
	•	A new Slack-like channel named “ShopperSim #001” or “BFSI Team #007.”
	•	Possibly pinned in the left sidebar.
	•	The user can jump in, watch the agent synergy.
	4.	Exceed Agent Limit:
	•	If the design calls for 100+ ephemeral agents, the channel lumps them under “Agent Team” heading.
	•	The user can see “Expand Agents” to individually talk or open sub-threads for them if necessary.
	5.	Task Tools:
	•	“Start/Pause/Stop” buttons or commands in the top bar of that new channel.
	•	A “sub-task log” or “DAG view” for advanced chains.
	6.	Output:
	•	The system pins final structured output or attachments in that agent team channel.
	•	The user can mark it “Done,” returning to main channel for next project.

7. Final Summary

In essence:
	•	Phase A & B: The user dialogues with Nova in the main channel to refine or “research & plan” an agent solution. No agent is fully spawned—only ephemeral planning.
	•	Phase C: The user confirms. Nova (the orchestrator) spawns the agent solution in a new channel or sub-thread.
	•	Phase D: Execution unfolds there, with the user optionally speaking with sub-agents. If it’s wrong, they revert to main channel, re-do design.
	•	Stop/Pause commands are available, plus sub-task creation if new tasks arise.
	•	Define “Done” & produce final output. Agents dissolve or move to “archived.”

All interactions are facilitated by specific endpoints for conversations, design management, solution spawning, project tasks, and sub-agent logs—all served behind a FastAPI interface for the Slack-like UI to call.

Thus, the user sees a multi-phase approach to creating agent solutions, ensuring research, planning, and final user sign-off are done before a big agent team is formed—and the user always has a route back to Nova to pivot or re-spawn if they discover mistakes mid-execution.
