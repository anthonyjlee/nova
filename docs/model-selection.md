Below is an updated plan describing how to change models for existing agents in a conversational manner using a Model Selection Agent (MSA) (or similar concept) within your NIA architecture

1. High-Level Flow for Conversational Model Switching
	1.	User or System initiates a conversation:
	•	“Agent X, please switch to uncensored meta 3.1 for BFSI conversation,” or “We want to do advanced domain embeddings with medBERTv2—please use that from now on.”
	2.	Model Selection Agent (MSA) acknowledges the user’s desire to switch models and checks whether the model is valid for that domain or whether concurrency/cost constraints apply.
	3.	MSA (or Nova Orchestrator) updates the existing agent’s “model reference” to the newly requested model in the Model Garden.
	4.	Agent continues operating but with the newly assigned model.
	5.	Conversational confirmation: The user can ask, “Agent X, confirm you’re now using medBERTv2,” and the agent verifies the assignment.

2. Implementation Steps

2.1. Expanded Model Registry (Recap)

class ModelRegistry:
    def __init__(self):
        self.models = {}
    
    def register_model(self, name: str, model_instance):
        self.models[name] = model_instance
    
    def get_model(self, name: str):
        return self.models.get(name)

model_registry = ModelRegistry()
# Register various models: "medBERTv2", "uncensoredMeta3.1", "gpt-4", etc.

2.2. Agents with a “model_name” Field

In each agent class (e.g., BeliefAgent, ResearchAgent), store both a model_name and model_instance:

class ResearchAgent:
    def __init__(self, name: str, model_registry, initial_model_name="medBERT", **kwargs):
        self.name = name
        self.model_registry = model_registry
        self.model_name = initial_model_name
        # The actual model reference
        self.model = self.model_registry.get_model(self.model_name)
    
    def set_model(self, new_model_name: str):
        """Change model reference at runtime."""
        new_model = self.model_registry.get_model(new_model_name)
        if new_model:
            self.model_name = new_model_name
            self.model = new_model
            return True
        return False

    async def process_data(self, text):
        """Example usage with the chosen model."""
        # e.g. embed or do inference
        return self.model.embed(text)

2.3. The Model Selection Agent (MSA)

A dedicated agent that can handle:
	•	Recommendation: “Based on BFSI domain, we propose ‘uncensoredMeta3.1’ for conversation.”
	•	Runtime Switch: Accept user or system request: “Switch agent X’s model to Y.”
	•	Validation: Check usage constraints, concurrency or domain mismatch.

MSA Example

class ModelSelectionAgent:
    def __init__(self, model_registry, analytics_agent):
        self.model_registry = model_registry
        self.analytics_agent = analytics_agent

    async def handle_model_change_request(self, agent, desired_model: str):
        # 1) Validate if desired_model is in the registry
        if desired_model not in self.model_registry.models:
            return f"Model '{desired_model}' not found in the Model Garden."

        # 2) Check analytics constraints (e.g. concurrency, cost usage)
        if self._is_model_overloaded(desired_model):
            return f"Model '{desired_model}' is currently overloaded. Please try later."

        # 3) Actually set the agent's model
        success = agent.set_model(desired_model)
        if success:
            return f"{agent.name} successfully switched to model '{desired_model}'."
        else:
            return f"Failed to switch {agent.name} to '{desired_model}'."

    def _is_model_overloaded(self, model_name: str) -> bool:
        # Access analytics_agent data for concurrency or usage
        usage_stats = self.analytics_agent.get_usage_stats(model_name)
        # dummy check
        if usage_stats.get("current_load", 0) > 0.8 * usage_stats.get("capacity", 1000):
            return True
        return False

2.4. Conversational “Tool/Function” for Model Switching

If you have a user or system that says “Switch the model,” you can do:

# Example: The conversation hits a special function call "change_model":
{
  "role": "assistant",
  "tool_calls": [
    {
      "function": {
         "name": "change_model",
         "description": "Switch agent's model"
      },
      "arguments": {
         "agent_name": "ResearchAgent1",
         "new_model_name": "medBERTv2"
      }
    }
  ]
}

Then in your code you parse:

tool_call = tool_calls[0]
agent_name = tool_call.arguments["agent_name"]
new_model_name = tool_call.arguments["new_model_name"]

# Suppose you find the agent object from your agent manager
agent_obj = agent_manager.get_agent_by_name(agent_name)

# Then pass to MSA
reply = await model_selection_agent.handle_model_change_request(agent_obj, new_model_name)
# add 'reply' back to conversation

2.5. Agent Acknowledgment & Confirmation

The user can query: “Which model are you using?” The agent might respond:

class ResearchAgent:
    ...
    async def respond_current_model(self):
        return f"I am {self.name}, currently using the '{self.model_name}' model."

3. Example Conversational Flow
	1.	User: “Hey Nova, can you ensure that ResearchAgent1 uses the new ‘medBERTv2’? I heard it’s better.”
	2.	NOVA:

# Possibly calls MSA
reply = await model_selection_agent.handle_model_change_request(research_agent1, "medBERTv2")
# e.g. returns "ResearchAgent1 successfully switched to model 'medBERTv2'."


	3.	NOVA replies to user with: “ResearchAgent1 is now using ‘medBERTv2’ for embeddings.”
	4.	User: “ResearchAgent1, confirm your model?”
	5.	ResearchAgent1: “I am ‘ResearchAgent1’, currently using ‘medBERTv2’ model.”

4. Considerations & Best Practices
	1.	State Persistence
	•	If you want the changed model to persist across restarts, store the agent’s model_name in ephemeral memory or Neo4j.
	2.	Analytics
	•	Use your AnalyticsAgent or token counting wrapper to track changes in usage cost or concurrency post-switch.
	3.	Error Handling
	•	If a newly requested model does not exist or is overloaded, the MSA can fallback to a default or prompt the user.
	4.	Security
	•	Possibly restrict model switching to certain roles or domain constraints. You might not want an untrusted user forcing the system to pick “uncensored meta 3.1.”

5. Conclusion

By adding a Model Selection Agent and letting it update an existing agent’s model_name at runtime:
	•	You enable a conversational approach: user or system can instruct, “Switch to the new model,” or “Which model are you using?”
	•	The agent or Nova can confirm or reject the switch, referencing usage constraints or domain alignment.
	•	This approach does not require re-spawning an entirely new agent; it simply changes the internal model reference in the agent’s code.
	•	You preserve concurrency, ephemeral memory usage, and your domain-labeled knowledge architecture.
