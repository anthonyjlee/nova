Below is a detailed plan integrating ephemeral (episodic) memory using chunking, long-term (semantic) memory in Neo4j, key-value numeric storage, plus a forward-looking approach to node embeddings for advanced knowledge retrieval. After the plan, you’ll find three example scenarios (conversation-based, emergent tasks, PDF ingestion) illustrating how the system might work in practice.

1. Overall Design
	1.	Episodic/Chunked Memory
	•	A short-term, ephemeral memory store for recent interactions or newly ingested documents.
	•	Implemented via chunking text and storing vector embeddings (e.g., in Qdrant/FAISS).
	•	Quick approximate lookups to handle queries that need immediate context.
	2.	Semantic/Long-Term Memory (Neo4j)
	•	A knowledge graph for stable facts, world knowledge, relationships, or validated numeric data.
	•	Best for storing “once verified or curated” facts, or concept relationships that rarely change.
	•	Potential for node embeddings or advanced graph-based retrieval.
	3.	Key-Value (Numeric) Storage
	•	Either a table, dictionary, or small structured DB keyed by (entity, attribute, date) → numeric value.
	•	Prevents hallucinated numeric data by checking facts here or in Neo4j (some numeric properties might be stored as Neo4j node attributes).
	4.	Nova as Meta-Orchestrator
	•	Nova coordinates ephemeral chunk retrieval (episodic memory), queries Neo4j for stable knowledge, merges numeric facts from the key-value store, and spawns new domain or specialized agents (like QAAgent, PDFAgent, or MemoryAgent).
	•	CoordinatorAgent might route tasks to the appropriate store, or handle multi-step retrieval if needed.
	5.	Progression
	•	Initially, you can keep chunk-level retrieval minimal (just k-nearest in a vector store).
	•	Over time, adopt more advanced node embeddings in Neo4j or multi-step graph traversals.

2. Detailed Plan for Each Layer

2.1. Episodic/Chunked Memory (Implementation)
	1.	Chunking
	•	Decide a chunk size (e.g., 512–1000 tokens) for conversation logs or ingested documents.
	•	Use a standard chunking approach (sliding window or paragraph-based chunking).
	•	Each chunk is ephemeral, i.e. it’s not guaranteed to be curated or 100% correct for the future.
	2.	Embedding & Vector Store
	•	Generate embeddings (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face).
	•	Store them in a vector DB like Qdrant or FAISS with metadata:
	•	{"doc_id": ..., "chunk_id": ..., "source_type": "conversation" or "PDF" or "webpage", "timestamp": ...}
	3.	Retrieval
	•	For a new query, do top-k nearest chunk retrieval. Possibly apply expansions (like cluster expansions or adjacency-based expansions if you implement it).
	4.	Lifecycle
	•	This ephemeral memory might be rotated out after some time or if it’s converted into curated knowledge for Neo4j.
	•	If a chunk becomes “verified and stable,” you might store a summarized version in Neo4j.

2.2. Long-Term Semantic Memory (Neo4j)
	1.	Graph Schema
	•	Nodes: Entities (people, companies, concepts).
	•	Relationships: “WORKS_AT,” “BELONGS_TO,” “DERIVED_FROM,” etc.
	•	Properties: store numeric or descriptive fields (e.g., company.name = "ABC Corp", company.net_income_2022 = 1.23B).
	2.	Data Ingestion
	•	Some facts from ephemeral memory or external sources eventually get curated into Neo4j.
	•	Possibly a specialized “KG Ingestion Agent” that checks chunk content, verifies with user or numeric store, and writes stable nodes/edges to Neo4j.
	3.	Retrieval
	•	If a query references stable, known facts or relationships, Nova or a specialized agent queries Neo4j with a straightforward property match (Cypher query).
	•	No Graph Hopping initially—just direct queries for property or adjacency.
	•	In the future, you can implement BFS or advanced graph-based expansions.
	4.	Node Embeddings (future step)
	•	Tools exist that generate embeddings for entire nodes based on their properties + relationships.
	•	You could store these embeddings in parallel with the node. Then a query’s embedding can do a similarity search across nodes in Neo4j or a side vector DB.
	•	This can unify concept-level retrieval with your chunk-based approach.

2.3. Key-Value Numeric Storage
	1.	Goal: Guarantee no numeric hallucinations.
	2.	Methods:
	•	Could be a dictionary or small SQL table.
	•	Or store them as node properties in Neo4j (like (:Company {name: "XYZ", net_income_2022: 1.23B})).
	•	During final answer generation, if the system references a numeric field, you do a fact-check step: “Look up exact field in the store.”
	3.	Coordination:
	•	Typically, the “FactCheckAgent” or a step in Nova’s answer generation ensures correct numeric substitution.

3. More Advanced Knowledge Retrieval (Node Embeddings)

3.1. Stepwise Implementation
	1.	Basic: Rely on chunk-level search in the vector store for ephemeral knowledge. Use direct property or relationship lookups in Neo4j for stable facts.
	2.	Node Embeddings: Over time, for each node in Neo4j, generate an embedding that captures its text properties and relationships.
	•	Tools like GraphSAGE or node2vec can generate embeddings from graph structure. Alternatively, you can compute an LLM-based embedding from node properties.
	•	Store these node embeddings in a separate vector index.
	3.	Query Workflow:
	•	Convert user query to an embedding, do a similarity match among node embeddings.
	•	Retrieve top matching nodes from the knowledge graph, then do expansions or check property details.
	4.	Merging: Combine node-level matches with chunk-level ephemeral matches from Qdrant. Let Nova unify them.

3.2. Future Graph Hopping
	•	Once you have node embeddings or a concept adjacency approach, you can do BFS expansions: “The user asked about ‘Tax rules for Company X’? Let’s hop from (:Company {name: 'X'}) to related nodes or relevant property edges.”
	•	Then unify the retrieved nodes with ephemeral chunks for final answer synthesis.

4. Three Example Scenarios

Example 1: Simple Conversation
	1.	User: “Hi Nova, how’s the progress on our last session about implementing marketing strategies?”
	2.	Nova: checks episodic memory (chunked conversation logs) to see what was said in the “last session.”
	•	Finds chunks referencing “marketing strategies.”
	3.	CoordinatorAgent: Queries vector DB with “progress on marketing strategies.”
	•	Returns top-3 chunks from ephemeral memory.
	4.	Nova uses these chunks to respond: “Last session, we discussed a social media campaign. So far, no new updates. Did you want to proceed?”
	•	No query to Neo4j needed, as it’s ephemeral context.
	•	No numeric data.
	•	Just a standard ephemeral memory retrieval.

Outcome: A standard chat referencing ephemeral conversation logs.

Example 2: Emergent Tasks and Their Results
	1.	User: “Nova, plan a small event for our product launch.”
	2.	Nova:
	•	Spawns specialized agents: “EventPlanningAgent” or uses an existing QAAgent to gather details.
	•	Agent does ephemeral retrieval for “previous product launch lessons.”
	3.	Agent: Finds ephemeral conversation from 2 months ago about event logistics.
	•	It says, “We used a small venue in Chicago,” etc.
	4.	Emergent Task: “We might need to contact a caterer.”
	•	The system sees this as a new subtask → shows up in ephemeral memory as “task_catering” with status: pending.
	5.	CoordinatorAgent / Nova auto-approves the creation of a “CateringAgent” or decides an existing agent can handle it.
	6.	CateringAgent completes the subtask → “We found a local caterer; cost is $2,000.”
	•	If exact numeric data is relevant for budget, we might confirm or store it in ephemeral memory for the short term. Possibly, if it’s critical for long term, we record in Neo4j as a “Cost node” or “Property for the event.”

Result: The system used ephemeral chunk retrieval to recall old events, emergent tasks spawned by the agent. No advanced graph or numeric store needed here unless we want to store final cost or vendor info in Neo4j for future reference.

Example 3: Working with PDFs
	1.	User: “Nova, can you summarize the Q2 financial report in myfile.pdf and check the net profit data?”
	2.	PDFAgent:
	•	Splits the PDF into multiple chunks (like 512–1000 tokens or paragraph-based).
	•	Embeds and inserts them into ephemeral vector DB (Qdrant).
	3.	CoordinatorAgent or Nova**:
	•	Queries ephemeral chunk store with “Q2 financial report summary.”
	•	Finds relevant text about “Net Profit: $5.23M.”
	4.	Numeric Fact Check:
	•	Nova checks whether there’s an existing node in Neo4j or a key-value store that says “Q2 net profit = $5.2M.” If it matches or differs, Nova either corrects or confirms.
	•	Possibly the user has a “Finance” node in Neo4j with “net_profit_Q2 = 5.2M.”
	5.	Nova merges ephemeral chunk summary + the numeric data from the fact store or Neo4j property. Produces a final summary:
	•	“The Q2 financial report indicates a net profit of $5.2M, matching our stored figure. Here’s a short synopsis of other data points…”

Outcome:
	•	The PDF is chunked (so ephemeral memory can retrieve relevant paragraphs).
	•	The numeric field is verified with Neo4j or a key-value dictionary.
	•	No complicated graph BFS is needed if we’re not exploring relationships beyond a direct numeric property check.
