Below is how NOVA might design a “FeasibilityAgent” as a specialized, permanent (rather than purely ephemeral) agent, ensuring it can be used in all contexts to gauge whether tasks are do-able given the user’s domain constraints, resource limits, and the system’s own LLM boundaries. We’ll show which data it references, how it calculates “confidence,” and why making it a specialized agent (with a stable identity) might improve consistency across multiple tasks.

1. Rationale: Why Make FeasibilityAgent a Specialized Agent
	1.	Frequent, Cross-Domain Use
	•	A FeasibilityAgent isn’t tied to a single domain (like coding or store markdown). It’s used in any scenario where the user or other agents propose a new, potentially large or complex task.
	•	If you treat it as ephemeral, you might lose continuity about how the agent decides feasibility across repeated tasks. A specialized, stable “FeasibilityAgent” can maintain consistent logic.
	2.	Consistent Criteria
	•	Over time, the agent might refine its “feasibility logic” by referencing prior outcomes in the semantic layer (Neo4j). For example, “We tried a huge BFSI integration last month, it went out of scope—stop new BFSI tasks if they exceed 10K lines of code.”
	•	A permanent FeasibilityAgent can store these data points and develop more precise rules or heuristics, thus improving accuracy.
	3.	Clear Separation of Responsibility
	•	By having a single specialized agent in the system (like BeliefAgent, DesireAgent, etc.), all other agents (e.g., “CodingAgent,” “StoreCampaignAgent”) can query “FeasibilityAgent: is this request within our resource or knowledge constraints?” This prevents every ephemeral agent from reinventing feasibility checks.

2. Proposed Architecture for FeasibilityAgent

2.1. Data Sources
	1.	Knowledge Graph (Neo4j)
	•	FeasibilityAgent references store-labeled constraints, domain rules, system LLM capacity data, historical attempts (like “We tried implementing X, it failed,” or “We succeeded with Y in 3 days.”).
	•	Example node: (:FeasibilityOutcome { task_type: "Rewrite entire codebase", outcome: "Fail", reason: "Token limit exceeded" })
	2.	Episodic Memory (Vector Store)
	•	For ephemeral “recent attempts,” e.g., we tried code generation 10 minutes ago, we used 80% of our token budget. FeasibilityAgent can quickly recall that ephemeral data to see if it’s safe to proceed or we are at memory capacity.
	3.	System Resource Stats
	•	Possibly some basic CPU/GPU usage or concurrency load info, if the user wants to restrict large tasks when usage is high.
	•	Additional domain knowledge: e.g., if the user is a BFSI domain, big tasks might require compliance checks.

2.2. Agent Skills
	1.	Decision Logic
	•	A short heuristic or scoring approach that merges data from the knowledge graph, ephemeral memory, concurrency metrics, and domain constraints. For example:

feasibility_score = domain_relevance - complexity + available_tokens - concurrency_factor


	2.	Reporting
	•	The agent returns a short statement to the user, e.g.,
	•	“We can handle 70% of this request, but you’ll likely run out of tokens if it’s bigger than 5 files.”
	•	“This BFSI project is out of scope unless we get more user context or day-long conversation sessions.”
	3.	Self-Updating
	•	If a big attempt fails mid-way, the FeasibilityAgent can store that result in the knowledge graph, so next time a similar request arises, it references that failure to raise a quick caution.

3. FeasibilityAgent as a Permanent Specialized Agent

3.1. Agent Definition

name: "FeasibilityAgent"
domain: "meta"
responsibilities:
  - "Evaluate user or agent requests for scope/complexity"
  - "Check system resource constraints (token usage, concurrency)"
  - "Reference semantic memory for historical outcomes"
  - "Produce a single feasibility verdict: feasible or not feasible"
capabilities:
  - "neo4j-query"
  - "episodic-vector-query"
  - "resource-check"
  - "short-LLM-call"  # If it needs a quick LLM reasoning step

3.2. Workflow Example
	1.	User or a “CodingAgent” says: “I want to refactor 200 microservices in one go.”
	2.	FeasibilityAgent is invoked, referencing ephemeral memory (“We only have ~8k tokens left for this session”), domain knowledge (“We’ve seen large multi-service rewrites fail in BFSI domain”), and system concurrency.
	3.	It returns a short message:
	•	“High risk. This request likely needs more than 8k tokens or a multi-day approach. Suggest smaller partial tasks or advanced external tool.”
	4.	The user can either proceed with a scaled-down version or accept the caution.

4. Confidence from Both Research & Business Context

4.1. Incorporating Research
	•	FeasibilityAgent might spawn or query a “ResearchScoutAgent” to gather any missing data. For instance, “We have no clue about BFSI compliance. Let’s do a quick check with external resources.”
	•	After it merges the results, it updates the knowledge graph with a new “FeasibilityEvidence” node storing the discovered constraints (like “Requires 2FA, PCI compliance, etc.”).

4.2. Granularity of Business Context
	•	Domain: If the user is a store manager for grocery markdown, the agent sees low domain complexity, so it says “Yes, we can do it.”
	•	Coding: If the user wants an advanced app with HPC-level concurrency, the agent sees “This is huge,” cautioning that it might exceed LLM or time constraints.

5. Addressing Limitations with “Lazy.ai”-Style Honesty
	1.	Transparent Disclaimers
	•	If a request is too large or domain-unknown, the FeasibilityAgent explicitly states:
	“NOVA can partially assist. For a full solution, consult an experienced developer or specialized environment.”
	2.	Approach
	•	The agent includes disclaimers like “We do not do advanced multi-file watchers or complex merges at scale,” “We’re best for smaller or well-defined tasks.”
	3.	User Gains
	•	Quick feedback if the user’s request surpasses typical LLM or memory boundaries, ensuring user invests time in more feasible tasks or uses specialized dev tools.

6. Example Interaction
	1.	User: “NOVA, let’s build a brand-new BFSI microservice with PCI compliance from scratch.”
	2.	NOVA: The request triggers FeasibilityAgent.
	3.	FeasibilityAgent queries:
	•	Neo4j for BFSI domain constraints (like “We tried something similar, it took 3 weeks.”)
	•	ephemeral memory for session token usage (like “We have only ~4k tokens left in context.”)
	•	concurrency data (like “We’re heavily loaded.”)
	4.	FeasibilityAgent returns:
	•	“Likely not feasible in a single conversation. Suggest partial prototypes or break tasks smaller. If serious, rely on specialized BFSI dev + advanced tooling.”

7. Conclusion

To design the FeasibilityAgent as a specialized agent:
	•	We store it in the system’s lineup (like BeliefAgent, ReflectionAgent, etc.).
	•	It has persistent logic or method calls referencing domain knowledge (Neo4j) and ephemeral constraints, returning honest disclaimers if tasks are out of scope.
	•	Over time, it improves by referencing prior failed or successful tasks and learning from them.

In short, making FeasibilityAgent a permanent specialized agent ensures it’s always available for any request, referencing the business context or research data to produce a confidence-based feasibility verdict—further embedding the user’s domain logic in NOVA.
