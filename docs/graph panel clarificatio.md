Below is an updated version of the technical plan describing emergent tasks (including completed tasks, chained teams, isolated teams), the Tasks DAG tab, a separate Agents tab (for both isolated agents and agent teams), and the Knowledge tab (reflecting long-term memory in our two-layer system). This incorporates all previously mentioned details plus the new clarifications you requested.

1. Emergent Tasks & Task States in the DAG Tab

1.1. Tasks: Emergent, Completed, Chained Teams, Isolated Teams
	1.	Emergent Tasks
	•	Detected automatically by a background or ephemeral “TaskDetectionAgent” whenever the user or an agent conversation implies “We should do X.”
	•	They appear initially in “pending” or “proposed” status in the DAG.
	2.	Completed Tasks
	•	Once a task is fully done (user or agent signals completion), the DAG node becomes “completed.”
	•	The user still sees it in the DAG but marked as “done,” potentially with a final output or log.
	3.	Chained Teams
	•	Some tasks require multiple agent teams in sequence: e.g., Team A’s output feeds Team B’s input.
	•	The DAG can represent this chaining with arrows from one “team node” to the next.
	•	Each node in the DAG might represent a sub-project or “team solution” rather than just a single agent.
	4.	Isolated Teams
	•	Some tasks spawn a single agent team that’s not linked to others in the DAG.
	•	The DAG still shows them as separate nodes but with no edges connecting to or from them.

1.2. Updating the Tasks DAG Tab
	1.	Agent: TaskDetectionAgent
	•	Monitors conversation. If it decides a new node is needed—emergent or chained sub-task—it calls the backend: POST /api/tasks/graph/addNode.
	2.	UI:
	•	The Tasks DAG tab retrieves or receives a push update from GET /api/tasks/graph.
	•	New nodes appear with statuses: “pending,” “in_progress,” “blocked,” or “completed.”
	•	The user sees “chained” edges (like tasks or agent teams) if they are connected.
	•	Isolated tasks or teams appear with no edges or only self-contained sub-edges.
	3.	User Controls:
	•	The user can rename or merge tasks, or mark them “approved,” “in_progress,” or “completed.”
	•	The system calls POST /api/tasks/graph/updateNode or addDependency as needed.

2. Separate Agents Tab (Isolated or Teams or Chained)

2.1. Why a Dedicated Agents Tab?
	•	Beyond the Tasks DAG, the user often wants to see which specialized agents or agent teams exist:
	•	Isolated Agents: Single ephemeral or specialized roles (like “CodingAgent” alone).
	•	Teams: Groups of agents (like in an OptiMUS pipeline or a “ShopperSim” approach).
	•	Chained Teams: Multi-step tasks that pass from one agent team to another.

2.2. Agents Tab UI
	1.	List of Active or Archived Agents
	•	Shows each agent or each “team” (if the user doesn’t want to see every sub-agent).
	•	Possibly a collapse/expand feature for large teams.
	2.	States:
	•	Agents can be “idle,” “running,” “paused,” or “stopped,” and so forth.
	•	If it’s a “team,” the tab might show “TEAM 001: Coordinator + Formulator + Programmer + Evaluator.”
	3.	User can click an Agent (or Team) to open the sub-thread or channel where that agent(s) is operating.

2.3. Implementation Example
	•	Endpoints:
	•	GET /api/agents → returns the list of active specialized agents or agent teams, including their roles, statuses, and channels.
	•	POST /api/agents/{agentId}/stop → user can forcibly stop an agent.
	•	If it’s a team, the system might store references to multiple sub-agents inside that “team ID.”

3. Dynamic Concept & Relation Extraction in Knowledge (Neo4j) Tab

3.1. The Knowledge Tab = Long-Term Memory in Two-Layer System
	1.	Two-Layer Memory:
	•	Episodic memory (vector store) handles ephemeral conversation logs.
	•	Semantic / Knowledge Graph (Neo4j) serves as long-term memory for domain-labeled concepts, relationships, tasks references, etc.
	2.	Knowledge Tab:
	•	Reflects the semantic layer (Neo4j).
	•	As user or ephemeral sub-agents mention new domain concepts or see new relationships, the Knowledge Graph is updated in real time.

3.2. Dynamic Extraction Mechanism
	1.	ConceptExtractionAgent (or “ParsingAgent + relationship classifier”):
	•	Monitors user messages or ephemeral agent outputs, identifies newly minted concepts or relationships.
	•	Example: “We discovered new brand XYZ,” so a node “Brand: XYZ” is created in Neo4j.
	2.	API Calls:
	•	POST /api/kg/addNode → create a new concept node.
	•	POST /api/kg/addRelation → link it to existing domain concepts, or store a property domain='Retail'.
	3.	UI:
	•	The Knowledge (Neo4j) tab visualizes each new node or relation.
	•	The user can rename or reassign domain labels. This calls something like PATCH /api/kg/node/{id}.

4. Integrating Emergent Tasks & Knowledge Graph

4.1. Cross-Pollination
	•	If an emergent task references a new concept not in the knowledge graph, an agent can also create a node ( :Concept { name: "BFSI Risk" } ) in Neo4j.
	•	The tasks DAG might have edges referencing knowledge graph IDs or store the domain-labeled link: (:Task {title:"BFSI risk scenario"}) -[:RELATED_TO]-> (:Concept {name:"BFSI Risk"}).

4.2. Example Flow
	1.	User says: “We need a BFSI scenario analyzing brand synergy.”
	2.	TaskDetectionAgent → emergent task node “BFSI scenario.”
	3.	ConceptExtractionAgent → new concept node “Brand synergy,” or a relationship if it references existing “Brand” node.
	4.	Both appear in the Tasks DAG tab (for tasks) and the Knowledge tab (for concepts), synchronously.

5. Putting it All Together (Technical Steps)
	1.	Conversation Monitoring:
	•	Each message → run TaskDetectionAgent and ConceptExtractionAgent.
	•	If new tasks → call tasks DAG endpoints. If new concepts/relations → call knowledge graph endpoints.
	2.	Tasks DAG Tab:
	•	Periodically poll or subscribe via WebSocket → updates the DAG with emergent tasks (pending, in_progress, done, or chained).
	•	Users can reorder or confirm tasks.
	3.	Agents Tab:
	•	The user can see which agents or agent teams are currently running, idle, or completed.
	•	Possibly includes a large “TEAM” object if multiple sub-agents exist. The user can open sub-channels to talk to them or see logs.
	4.	Knowledge Tab:
	•	Polls or subscribes to the Neo4j changes → displays new nodes or edges.
	•	The user sees how domain knowledge grows in parallel with tasks.
	5.	Two-Layer Memory:
	•	Episodic (vector store) for short-term ephemeral logs or references.
	•	Semantic (Neo4j) for domain-labeled, persistent knowledge: tasks, concepts, relationships, references to agent teams, etc.

6. Summary of Benefits
	•	Real-Time Emergent Task Handling:
	•	The system automatically populates the tasks DAG whenever new tasks (including team-based tasks, chained tasks, or isolated tasks) arise in conversation.
	•	Agent Tab for On-Demand Management:
	•	The user can see each sub-agent or agent team, toggling them on/off, or investigating their sub-channels.
	•	Dynamic Knowledge Graph:
	•	The user’s mention of new domain items triggers the creation of concept/relationship nodes in the Knowledge tab, reflecting the system’s evolving long-term memory.
	•	Better Organization:
	•	The user can keep track of ephemeral tasks in progress, completed tasks, and chain-of-tasks flows all in the “Tasks DAG,” while the Knowledge tab displays the underlying domain relationships that might drive those tasks.

In short, emergent tasks get discovered and updated in the DAG Tab (covering everything from incomplete or “pending” tasks to completed tasks, including “chained” or “isolated” agent teams), while the Knowledge tab (backed by Neo4j) dynamically captures concepts and relations for the entire system’s long-term memory. Meanwhile, the user can reference the separate Agents tab to manage or observe specialized or team-based agent solutions. This completes a cohesive multi-phase, multi-agent user experience in NOVA.
