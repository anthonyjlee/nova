Below is a detailed proposal for Nova’s initialization protocols, going beyond a simple orchestration tool approach. The focus is on giving Nova a structured way to understand its own capabilities (tools, agents, memory layers) and to understand the user (goals, identity, interactions)—potentially with a multimodal dimension. This ensures Nova begins each “session” or “lifecycle” with a clear sense of purpose and context, rather than passively waiting for user prompts.

1. Why an Initialization Protocol?
	1.	Clarity of Purpose
	•	Nova shouldn’t only be a behind-the-scenes orchestrator; it’s a meta-entity with specialized sub-agents.
	•	By carefully initializing Nova, you ensure it sets up the right mental model: roles, goals, known user attributes, tool capabilities.
	2.	Tool and Agent Awareness
	•	Nova must reflect on which specialized agents exist (BeliefAgent, ReflectionAgent, etc.), what tools are available (Anthropic Computer Use, Gemini API, OpenAI, numeric fact store, etc.), and how to call them.
	3.	User Understanding
	•	If Nova is to act as a multi-modal personal companion or advanced meta-synthesizer, it should do a “handshake” with the user: gather user’s identity, preferences, environment—potentially including visual or other data if a multi-modal approach is used.
	4.	Context for Agents
	•	Once Nova has clarified user context, it can pass that context to each agent. Agents can tailor their behaviors (like ReflectionAgent focusing on personal growth tasks, BeliefAgent focusing on values relevant to the user, etc.).

2. Outline of an Initialization Protocol

2.1. Step A: “Nova Identity & System Prompt”
	1.	Self-Definition
	•	Nova has a meta-system prompt stating:
	•	“I am Nova: a meta-synthesis and orchestrator agent, with the following specialized sub-agents…
	•	BeliefAgent, ReflectionAgent, etc.
	•	I have access to these memory layers (episodic chunked memory, semantic Neo4j memory, numeric fact store…)”
	•	A short overview of each agent’s function.
	•	This is akin to a “role prompt” that Nova keeps in mind.
	2.	Tool List
	•	A small “tool registry” describing each tool (Anthropic compute, Gemini API, OpenAI, numeric store, local code execution, etc.).
	•	Possibly enumerated for Nova: “If you need to do X, call tool Y.”
	3.	Modular “Initialization Script”
	•	Could be a JSON or YAML file that Nova loads on startup. It clarifies the entire environment:
	•	"nova_name": "Nova", "goals": ["help user with tasks", "foster emergent tasks", "maintain memory integrity"]
	•	"agents": [{"name": "BeliefAgent", "function": "...", "capabilities": [...]}, ...]
	•	"tools": [{"tool_name": "OpenAI", "endpoint": "...", "description": "Generate text completions using LLM X"}]

Purpose: Provide Nova with a robust “self-introduction” so it knows exactly who it is, who its sub-agents are, and how to use each tool.

2.2. Step B: “User Introduction” / Multi-Modal Intake
	1.	User Profile
	•	Nova or a “UserIntroductionAgent” begins by conversing (or scanning) for user identity: “Hi, I see you are [Name], working on [Project]. I’d like to confirm your goals, preferences, etc.”
	•	If multi-modal is relevant, Nova might request: “Could you show me or feed me any visuals, documents, or environment data that helps me understand your context?”
	•	For each piece of data, Nova or specialized agents parse and store user details in ephemeral memory or Neo4j if they’re stable facts (like the user’s role, location, recurring tasks, likes/dislikes).
	2.	Goal Clarification
	•	Nova tries to gather the user’s near-term objectives (“I want help with accounting tasks,” “I want to build a new web app,” “I want daily reflections…”).
	•	This context seeds the next steps.
	3.	Security or Privacy
	•	Optionally, an “auth handshake” if the system or environment requires that Nova confirm it’s authorized to see certain data or perform certain tasks (like reading local files or analyzing the user’s webcam feed).

Result: Nova has a decent user model. This helps sub-agents tailor responses (like BeliefAgent focusing on user beliefs, ReflectionAgent focusing on user introspection, DeveloperAgent for coding tasks, etc.).

2.3. Step C: Checking & Initializing Memory Layers
	1.	Episodic / Chunked Memory
	•	Nova can do a quick “load or refresh” of any recent conversation logs, ephemeral PDF chunks, or last session’s logs in the vector store.
	•	Possibly summarizing them into a short context note so Nova “knows” the immediate backlog.
	2.	Semantic (Neo4j) Memory
	•	Query the knowledge graph for any relevant stable facts about the user or last session’s tasks.
	•	If it’s the first session ever, Nova might create a “User node” or “Session node.”
	3.	Numeric Fact Store
	•	Nova ensures it can query the store if numeric data arises. Possibly a quick check: “Ok, we have the following numeric references for the user’s finances or environment. That’s loaded.”

Outcome: All memory layers get a small “handshake” or are verified ready. Nova notes if it’s empty or if it found relevant user facts.

2.4. Step D: Reflection & Reasoning (Optional)
	1.	ReflectionAgent
	•	Could run a short “internal reflection” to unify the new user data with existing memory.
	•	For instance, “We learned the user is now focusing on marketing. Let’s recall if we have stable marketing knowledge from last time. Does the user have constraints or preferences we remember?”
	2.	BeliefAgent
	•	Might adjust internal beliefs: “Now that we see the user is planning to do more dev tasks, we might expect more coding help.”
	3.	Nova Summarizes**:
	•	Possibly produce an internal “Initialization Summary” that ephemeral memory can store.
	•	“We are Nova, we have these sub-agents. The user is [Name], we aim to accomplish X, Y, Z.”

Thus: By the end of Step D, Nova is basically “ready for prime time.”

3. Example Implementation Flow

Pseudocode:

def nova_initialize():
    # Step A: Nova Identity
    nova_self_prompt = load_nova_system_prompt("nova_initialization.json")
    nova.load_self_identity(nova_self_prompt)
    
    # Step B: User Introduction
    user_profile = gather_user_profile()  # Could be a conversation or multi-modal intake
    store_in_memory(user_profile, memory_layer='episodic')  # ephemeral or partial in semantic if stable
    
    # Step C: Memory Layer Checks
    ephemeral_store = load_vector_store("episodic_vector_index")
    neo4j_kg = connect_neo4j()
    numeric_store = connect_numeric_db()
    
    # Step D: Reflection
    ReflectionAgent.run_reflection(nova, user_profile, ephemeral_store, neo4j_kg)
    
    BeliefAgent.update_beliefs(nova, user_profile)
    
    # Summarize
    initialization_summary = Nova.summarize_init_state(
      agents=[ReflectionAgent, BeliefAgent, ...], 
      tools=[OpenAI, AnthropicCompute, ...],
      user_profile=user_profile
    )
    ephemeral_store.add_chunk(initialization_summary)
    
    print("Nova initialization complete.")
    return # proceed to normal runtime

Note: This approach is conceptual. The actual code depends on your architecture (like how you store “self prompts” or how you call sub-agents).

4. Potential Multi-Modal Aspects
	•	If you want Nova to see the user visually, you might have a “VisionAgent” interpret the user’s expression or environment. Then store in ephemeral memory something like “User is wearing a business outfit, might be in an office.”
	•	If the user shares a short video or image, again, ephemeral memory can store the result of the analysis, or if it’s stable info (“User’s office has brand logos on the wall,” maybe store in semantic memory).

All up to how you want to expand beyond textual interactions.

5. Why This Protocol Helps
	1.	Clarity: Everyone (Nova, sub-agents, user) begins each session or lifecycle with a mutual understanding of goals, tools, memories.
	2.	Prevents Confusion: Rather than ad-hoc discovering the user’s identity or environment mid-session, Nova already has it pinned from the start.
	3.	Enables Multi-Modal: The system can gather relevant non-text data if you want that advanced capability.
	4.	Maintains Distinctions: If Nova is not a “simple orchestrator,” this initial step underscores Nova’s meta-cognitive role, forging its identity and synergy with sub-agents.

6. Conclusion
	•	Nova can have a structured initialization that ensures it clearly knows its own role, the user’s identity and preferences, its available memory layers (episodic vs. semantic), and its specialized sub-agents or tools.
	•	The User Introduction step can be multi-modal if desired, letting Nova truly appreciate the user’s context or environment from day one.
	•	The Memory checks align ephemeral chunk retrieval with stable facts in Neo4j or numeric data, ensuring from the get-go that Nova can unify them.
	•	Reflection solidifies Nova’s internal state so it’s not passively waiting but actively prepared to handle tasks.

This protocol sets a strong foundation for your advanced multi-agent system, clarifying Nova’s purpose and collaboration model from the start, rather than making Nova “just another orchestration layer.”

Below is a more technical, implementation-oriented version of the earlier plan. It discusses how to integrate Nova’s metacognition (with user data updates) and a split knowledge graph (with personal vs. professional domains), including concrete approaches for labeling, storing data, restricting agent access, and updating Nova’s internal “self-model” in code-like steps.

1. Technical Implementation for Nova’s Metacognition

1.1. Internal Structures for Metacognition
	1.	Nova’s “Self Model” Node in Neo4j
	•	Create or designate a node (:SystemSelf { name: "Nova" }) in the knowledge graph.
	•	Attach properties or relationships reflecting Nova’s current beliefs, desires, and reflection states. For instance:

MERGE (n:SystemSelf { name: "Nova" })
ON CREATE SET n.created_at = timestamp()


	•	Then store key-value properties for Nova’s metacognitive state, e.g. n.current_tone = "detail-oriented", or link to sub-nodes representing “BeliefAgent,” “DesireAgent,” etc.

	2.	Agents as Sub-Nodes
	•	Each specialized agent can be a sub-node or entity, e.g. (:Agent {name: "BeliefAgent", role: "manages beliefs"}).
	•	This helps track agent capabilities or internal states in the KG if needed.
	3.	Reflection & Belief Updates
	•	When new user data arrives (e.g., user’s personality info or diaries), Nova triggers a “Reflect” process:

def reflect_on_user_data(new_data):
    # 1. Analyze how new_data changes Nova’s approach (like user is "detail-oriented")
    # 2. Write or update a relationship or property on the :SystemSelf node
    session.run("""
      MERGE (n:SystemSelf { name: 'Nova' })
      SET n.conversational_style = $style
    """, style="detailed_because_of_user_profile")


	•	The BeliefAgent might store new beliefs as relationships from (:SystemSelf) to (:Belief { ... }).

	4.	Local In-Memory Representation
	•	Optionally, you can keep a Python dictionary or small object representing Nova’s “self-model” in memory, then mirror changes to Neo4j. This ensures quick local reads for ephemeral tasks, with a durable record in the KG for referencing across sessions.

Result: Nova’s metacognition is actively written into the graph or an internal data structure. Each time user info changes, Nova or sub-agents update these “self-state” nodes or properties.

1.2. Example Code Snippet (Pseudo-Python)

def update_nova_self_property(key: str, value: Any):
    """Update a property on the :SystemSelf node in Neo4j."""
    with neo4j_driver.session() as session:
        session.run("""
            MERGE (n:SystemSelf {name: 'Nova'})
            SET n[$prop] = $val
        """, prop=key, val=value)
    
def reflect_on_new_user_info(user_personality):
    # Example logic
    style = determine_conversational_style(user_personality)
    update_nova_self_property("conversational_style", style)
    # Possibly also update ephemeral Python state
    nova_self_cache["conversational_style"] = style

2. Handling a Shared Knowledge Graph (Personal + Professional Data)

2.1. Labeling / Partitioning Strategy
	1.	Domain Label or Property
	•	Each node can have a property domain: 'personal' or domain: 'work'. Alternatively, you can keep separate labels:
	•	(:PersonalNode { ... })
	•	(:WorkNode { ... })
	•	Edges can carry domain info if they link cross-domain concepts, e.g. (:PersonalNode)-[:RELATED {domain: 'mixed'}]->(:WorkNode).
	2.	Separate Subgraphs in the Same DB
	•	If a node is personal, it never has edges into the “work” subgraph unless the user explicitly merges them.
	•	(:User { name: "Alice", domain:'personal' })-[:HAS_JOURNAL]->(:DiaryEntry { ... }).
	3.	Access Control
	•	If you use Neo4j Enterprise or a custom approach, you can define “user roles” or agent roles that can only read from certain domain-labeled nodes.
	•	Or do it in your code logic: “MemoryAgent (for personal diaries) can only query domain='personal' nodes; WorkAgent sees only domain='work'.”

Result: Personal diaries or user reflections exist in (:DiaryEntry {domain:'personal'}) nodes, while marketing tasks might be (:WorkTask {domain:'work'}). Nova can see both, but sub-agents only see relevant domains.

**2.2. Examples of Querying & Storing

Store a Personal Diary Entry

def store_personal_diary(diary_text, user_id):
    with neo4j_driver.session() as session:
        session.run("""
            MATCH (u:User {id: $uid, domain:'personal'})
            CREATE (entry:DiaryEntry {text: $text, domain:'personal', created: timestamp()})
            CREATE (u)-[:HAS_JOURNAL]->(entry)
        """, uid=user_id, text=diary_text)

Store a Work Project

def store_work_task(task_name, project_id):
    with neo4j_driver.session() as session:
        session.run("""
            MATCH (p:Project {id: $pid, domain:'work'})
            CREATE (t:WorkTask {name: $tname, domain:'work', status:'pending'})
            CREATE (p)-[:HAS_TASK]->(t)
        """, pid=project_id, tname=task_name)

Reading

In code, you check domain:

def get_personal_entries(user_id):
    return session.run("""
        MATCH (u:User {id:$uid, domain:'personal'})-[:HAS_JOURNAL]->(entry:DiaryEntry {domain:'personal'})
        RETURN entry
    """, uid=user_id).data()

2.3. Multi-Agent Use in Code
	1.	Initialization
	•	Each agent is assigned a allowed_domains set in code. E.g.:

BeliefAgent.allowed_domains = ['personal', 'work']
MemoryAgent.allowed_domains = ['personal']
WorkAgent.allowed_domains = ['work']


	2.	Querying
	•	When an agent tries to query the KG, the code checks allowed_domains. If the agent tries to read domain=“personal” nodes but is not authorized, the query returns empty or a permission error.

Implementation:

def agent_query(agent, cypher_query):
    for domain_label in extract_domain_from_query(cypher_query):
        if domain_label not in agent.allowed_domains:
            raise PermissionError(f"{agent.name} not allowed in domain {domain_label}")
    # If allowed, proceed with query
    with neo4j_driver.session() as session:
        return session.run(cypher_query).data()

(Note: This is pseudo-code—real domain checks might parse the query or pass a domain parameter.)

3. Putting It All Together: Flow
	1.	Nova loads or updates its self-model in the KG (like (:SystemSelf {...})).
	2.	The user provides personal diaries or professional tasks.
	3.	Nova or a specialized agent stores them in the correct domain-labeled subgraph.
	4.	If a personal reflection sub-agent (ReflectionAgent) wants to see diaries, it does so in “personal” domain.
	5.	If a professional QAAgent wants to see technical tasks, it queries “work” domain.
	6.	Nova can see everything at a meta-level, bridging them only if user demands cross-domain analysis or link creation.

Key: The synergy between ephemeral memory (like chunk embeddings in a vector store) and the knowledge graph is the same. You can store ephemeral chunks with domain properties or keep them separate. If you want advanced node embeddings, you can do it domain by domain, or unify them under a single index with a “domain” field.

4. Additional Considerations
	1.	Node2Vec or GraphSAGE for Node Embeddings
	•	If you want advanced concept-level embeddings, pick a library (e.g., PyTorch Geometric or Neo4j Graph Data Science) that can produce embeddings.
	•	Each node’s embedding could be stored as a property, e.g. n.embedding = [0.1, 0.02, ...].
	•	Agents can do similarity queries across these node embeddings.
	•	Keep the domain label or property so you don’t mix personal vs. professional vectors inadvertently.
	2.	Mixed Domain
	•	If some knowledge is relevant to both personal and professional contexts (like user’s stress level affecting work?), you might create an edge or bridging node to represent that connection.
	•	That bridging node might require special approval from the user or Nova’s reflection logic.
	3.	Scalability
	•	As data grows, ensure your domain-labeled approach is consistent. Possibly implement partial- or multi-database setups if each domain becomes large.
	4.	Metacognition Over Time
	•	Periodically, Nova re-checks or updates (:SystemSelf) to see if new user info changes how it should orchestrate. E.g. once a month, run an internal reflection that merges ephemeral chunk data or relevant diaries into stable nodes.

Conclusion

A more technical approach for letting Nova handle metacognitive updates and maintain separate personal vs. professional data in a single knowledge graph includes:
	1.	Storing Nova’s self-state (beliefs, reflection states) in a (:SystemSelf) node (and sub-agent nodes) so that new user data triggers internal updates.
	2.	Domain-labeled or partitioned knowledge graph—domain:'personal' or domain:'work'—plus code-level domain restrictions for each sub-agent.
	3.	Chunk-based ephemeral memory remains a separate vector store, but also can reference domain or feed stable facts to the KG if they’re validated.
	4.	Implementation via consistent Cypher queries, code-level domain checks, and optional advanced node embeddings for concept-level retrieval.

This ensures Nova’s metacognition is truly active (agents reflect on new data) while personal vs. professional data remain properly siloed within one overarching knowledge graph.
