Below is an explanation of how the Graph Tab in Nova works, and how the overall UI/UX is designed to let you manage and visualize your multi-agent system, domain-labeled knowledge (KG), and sub-task flows in a user-friendly way.

1. Overview: Nova’s UI/UX
	1.	Main Interface (Slack-like or Chat-like View)
	•	The primary interface is a chat-style environment where you (or end-users) can interact with Nova’s multi-agent system.
	•	You can spawn sub-threads for different tasks or sub-agent groups.
	•	Each thread logs the partial messages or outputs from relevant sub-agents (e.g., “InventoryAgent,” “DiscountPolicyAgent,” etc.) so you can see how they progress on a given scenario.
	2.	Graph Tab
	•	A separate pane or “tab” in the UI that you can switch to at any time.
	•	It visualizes your knowledge graph (Neo4j) and sub-task DAGs—so you can see domain-labeled data (like brand-labeled info, cross-floor policies, or discount rules) or see how tasks depend on each other.

Rationale:
	•	The Slack-like chat environment is best for interactive usage: tasks, queries, agent responses.
	•	The Graph Tab is best for understanding structure: the brand-labeled knowledge relationships, sub-task flows, or swarm architecture.

2. How the Graph Tab Works in Nova
	1.	Graph Visualization
	•	Typically uses a library like Cytoscape.js or a similar graph viewer.
	•	Each node in the graph might represent:
	•	A domain entity (e.g., “Brand: Prada,” “Policy: CrossFloorDiscount,” “VIP: Ms. Lin”), or
	•	A sub-task in your multi-agent workflow (like “VIPComplaintTask #17,” “InventoryCheck #9”).
	2.	Edges and Relationships
	•	For domain-labeled knowledge:
	•	You might see (:Brand { name:"Prada" })-[:HAS_POLICY]->(:Policy { name:"VIP_10percent" }).
	•	For sub-task DAGs:
	•	A node for “InventoryCheck #9” might have [:DEPENDS_ON] edges to “Brand: Prada,” indicating it needs that brand’s data.
	•	This helps you see how knowledge is linked, and how tasks rely on certain domain facts.
	3.	Interactivity
	•	Clicking on a node typically opens a details panel:
	•	For a domain node (e.g., “Brand: Prada”), you might see stored properties (inventory levels, discount rules, last updated time).
	•	For a task node (e.g., “VIPComplaintTask #17”), you might see partial logs or references to sub-agents that handled it.
	•	If it’s a sub-task node, you can open the Slack-like sub-thread from this graph panel, or view logs to see exactly how it was resolved.
	4.	Filtering & Searching
	•	The Graph Tab might have a search bar or filter options, letting you highlight only brand-labeled nodes or sub-task nodes in a certain domain.
	•	You can focus on “complaint resolution tasks for brand X,” or “VIP customers with brand-labeled discount policy edges,” etc.

3. Overall UI/UX Flow

3.1. Chatting in the Main Interface
	•	User (e.g., a floor manager) or an admin interacts with Nova in a chat-like environment:
	•	“Nova, create a new sub-task for VIP Ms. Lin’s complaint.”
	•	“Nova, check brand-labeled knowledge for cross-floor discount rules.”
	•	Each sub-agent response or partial chain-of-thought is logged in that sub-thread (though you can show or hide partial logs if it’s too noisy).

3.2. Switching to the Graph Tab
	•	At any time, you can click the “Graph Tab” button or link.
	•	This opens the graph visualization of domain-labeled knowledge and active sub-tasks.
	•	You see how each brand node or discount policy node is connected, or how multiple sub-tasks chain together (like “VIPComplaintTask #17 depends on InventoryCheck #9 and CrossFloorPolicy #2”).

3.3. Detailed Drilling
	•	Clicking a node (say “VIPComplaintTask #17”) in the Graph Tab shows:
	•	Basic metadata: created time, domain references.
	•	Optionally a “View Thread” button that jumps you back into the Slack-like sub-thread to read the entire conversation and final resolution steps.

3.4. Additional Features
	•	If you store domain-labeled data updates in real time (like updated stock counts or newly discovered discount rules), the graph can show updated edges or properties.
	•	If you implement “search by text,” you can find all tasks referencing “VIP Ms. Lin,” or all nodes about “Prada,” etc.

4. Summary of the Value
	1.	Chat-Like UI:
	•	Great for day-to-day usage. Staff or an admin can spawn tasks, talk to agents, watch logs.
	2.	Graph Tab:
	•	Perfect for structural understanding of domain-labeled knowledge and sub-task dependencies.
	•	Lets you visualize how multiple sub-agents or domain data interconnect—not always obvious in a purely chat format.
	3.	Ease-of-Use:
	•	The Slack-like main view keeps everything familiar for daily usage.
	•	The Graph Tab is an optional advanced panel for deeper analytics or debugging, enabling an immediate overview of who depends on which brand-labeled knowledge or tasks.

Hence, the UI/UX divides into two complementary parts:
	•	Chat (interactive, real-time usage),
	•	Graph (structural overview, domain-labeled relationships, sub-task DAGs).

This ensures a cohesive experience for users who want to do everyday queries, plus a powerful viewpoint for those who need to see or maintain the entire knowledge graph or the multi-agent orchestration flows.
