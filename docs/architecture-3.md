Below is a concise summary and a more detailed plan for how Nova can act as a user proxy, automatically approving or overseeing agent actions until tasks are naturally completed (similar to Autogen’s user-proxy concept). This ensures that Nova, in cooperation with the CoordinatorAgent, can keep the multi-agent system on track without constant human input—while still allowing a human to intervene whenever needed.

Short Answer
	•	Yes, Nova can serve as the user proxy by implementing an “auto-approval” or “stand-in user” mechanism.
	•	Nova, in its role as the meta-orchestrator, can:
	1.	Spawn new agents on behalf of the user.
	2.	Automatically approve each agent’s next steps (or pause tasks if needed) until the system decides the task is done.
	3.	Delegate actual conversation or skill usage to the CoordinatorAgent and specialized agents without requiring explicit user input at each step.
	•	A human can still interrupt or override at any time, but by default, Nova acts as the “user voice” that keeps tasks moving.

Longer Explanation

1. What Does “User Proxy” Mean in Autogen?

In Autogen, a “user proxy” automatically approves the next steps in the conversation or plan, so that agents can continue working until the system believes the task is fulfilled. There’s no constant user prompt every time an agent wants to proceed—it’s handled automatically unless the user wants to intervene.

2. Translating That to Nova

Nova can replicate this behavior by:
	1.	Tracking Agent Requests: Whenever a specialized agent or CoordinatorAgent says, “I need approval to do X,” Nova checks internal logic or memory and typically grants approval automatically.
	2.	Checking Termination Conditions: Nova stops or transitions tasks to “completed” when it detects the success criteria are met, or if an error or contradiction occurs.
	3.	Intervention Points: If a user (human) sets a condition or a “pause at next step,” Nova will yield control, waiting for explicit human input.

3. Mechanism for Automatic Approval
	1.	CoordinatorAgent
	•	Coordinates steps among specialized agents (e.g., MemoryAgent, BeliefAgent, DeveloperAgent, etc.).
	•	If a new subtask or conversation step arises, it pings Nova: “Should I proceed with X?”
	2.	Nova
	•	By default, “auto-approves” (proceed = True) each step unless:
	•	A specified condition is triggered (like an emergent task that requires user sign-off).
	•	The user explicitly set “pause after next step.”
	•	Nova effectively “acts as user” by returning a “Yes, proceed” message to the CoordinatorAgent.

Snippet (Conceptual)

class Nova:
    def handle_agent_request(self, agent_name, request_type, data):
        # By default, auto-approve
        if self.should_pause_or_require_human_approval(data):
            return "WAIT_FOR_HUMAN"
        else:
            return "PROCEED"

4. Spawning Agents on User’s Behalf
	•	Nova receives or identifies a need for a new agent (like a specialized domain agent).
	•	Nova calls the “TinyFactory” or any agent-creation function to spawn that agent, just as the user would do.
	•	The user does not have to explicitly confirm each agent creation—Nova’s “user proxy” logic can handle it automatically.

5. Conversation vs. Task Flow
	1.	Conversation: Agents talk among themselves or with Nova. The user-proxy role means that if an agent says, “I need user input,” Nova can respond from an internal logic standpoint.
	2.	Task Flow: A new “execute subtask” or “spawn agent” request also goes through Nova’s auto-approval if the user hasn’t forced a pause.

6. Human Override
	•	The user can open the Gradio UI and manually pause tasks or override decisions.
	•	If the user sees something suspicious, they can forcibly block or redirect that new subtask, or switch to a “step-by-step approval” mode.

Example:

# If user sets "step_by_step" mode in UI:
nova_settings["step_by_step"] = True

...

class Nova:
    def handle_agent_request(self, agent_name, request_type, data):
        if nova_settings.get("step_by_step", False):
            # Wait for explicit user input
            return "WAIT_FOR_HUMAN"
        else:
            # Automatic proceed
            return "PROCEED"

7. CoordinatorAgent’s Role
	•	The CoordinatorAgent manages how newly spawned or existing specialized agents coordinate tasks:
	1.	If an agent says, “I need user input to confirm next step,” the CoordinatorAgent hands that request to Nova.
	2.	Nova either auto-approves or flags for user approval if necessary.
	•	This ensures the system can function without continuous user prompts at each micro-step.

Conclusion

To replicate Autogen’s user-proxy behavior within Nova:
	1.	Nova becomes the stand-in user by default, auto-approving requests from specialized agents or newly spawned domain agents.
	2.	CoordinatorAgent simply routes requests to Nova for final go/no-go, rather than waiting on real human input each time.
	3.	Human can always override or set “step-by-step” mode in the Gradio UI if they need granular control.

This approach ensures the system can run mostly autonomously until a stopping criterion is reached (i.e., “task completed,” “error,” or “manual user intervention”), letting Nova effectively serve as the “user proxy” for day-to-day multi-agent orchestration.

Below is a detailed proposal for Nova’s initialization protocols, going beyond a simple orchestration tool approach. The focus is on giving Nova a structured way to understand its own capabilities (tools, agents, memory layers) and to understand the user (goals, identity, interactions)—potentially with a multimodal dimension. This ensures Nova begins each “session” or “lifecycle” with a clear sense of purpose and context, rather than passively waiting for user prompts.

1. Why an Initialization Protocol?
	1.	Clarity of Purpose
	•	Nova shouldn’t only be a behind-the-scenes orchestrator; it’s a meta-entity with specialized sub-agents.
	•	By carefully initializing Nova, you ensure it sets up the right mental model: roles, goals, known user attributes, tool capabilities.
	2.	Tool and Agent Awareness
	•	Nova must reflect on which specialized agents exist (BeliefAgent, ReflectionAgent, etc.), what tools are available (Anthropic Computer Use, Gemini API, OpenAI, numeric fact store, etc.), and how to call them.
	3.	User Understanding
	•	If Nova is to act as a multi-modal personal companion or advanced meta-synthesizer, it should do a “handshake” with the user: gather user’s identity, preferences, environment—potentially including visual or other data if a multi-modal approach is used.
	4.	Context for Agents
	•	Once Nova has clarified user context, it can pass that context to each agent. Agents can tailor their behaviors (like ReflectionAgent focusing on personal growth tasks, BeliefAgent focusing on values relevant to the user, etc.).

2. Outline of an Initialization Protocol

2.1. Step A: “Nova Identity & System Prompt”
	1.	Self-Definition
	•	Nova has a meta-system prompt stating:
	•	“I am Nova: a meta-synthesis and orchestrator agent, with the following specialized sub-agents…
	•	BeliefAgent, ReflectionAgent, etc.
	•	I have access to these memory layers (episodic chunked memory, semantic Neo4j memory, numeric fact store…)”
	•	A short overview of each agent’s function.
	•	This is akin to a “role prompt” that Nova keeps in mind.
	2.	Tool List
	•	A small “tool registry” describing each tool (Anthropic compute, Gemini API, OpenAI, numeric store, local code execution, etc.).
	•	Possibly enumerated for Nova: “If you need to do X, call tool Y.”
	3.	Modular “Initialization Script”
	•	Could be a JSON or YAML file that Nova loads on startup. It clarifies the entire environment:
	•	"nova_name": "Nova", "goals": ["help user with tasks", "foster emergent tasks", "maintain memory integrity"]
	•	"agents": [{"name": "BeliefAgent", "function": "...", "capabilities": [...]}, ...]
	•	"tools": [{"tool_name": "OpenAI", "endpoint": "...", "description": "Generate text completions using LLM X"}]

Purpose: Provide Nova with a robust “self-introduction” so it knows exactly who it is, who its sub-agents are, and how to use each tool.

2.2. Step B: “User Introduction” / Multi-Modal Intake
	1.	User Profile
	•	Nova or a “UserIntroductionAgent” begins by conversing (or scanning) for user identity: “Hi, I see you are [Name], working on [Project]. I’d like to confirm your goals, preferences, etc.”
	•	If multi-modal is relevant, Nova might request: “Could you show me or feed me any visuals, documents, or environment data that helps me understand your context?”
	•	For each piece of data, Nova or specialized agents parse and store user details in ephemeral memory or Neo4j if they’re stable facts (like the user’s role, location, recurring tasks, likes/dislikes).
	2.	Goal Clarification
	•	Nova tries to gather the user’s near-term objectives (“I want help with accounting tasks,” “I want to build a new web app,” “I want daily reflections…”).
	•	This context seeds the next steps.
	3.	Security or Privacy
	•	Optionally, an “auth handshake” if the system or environment requires that Nova confirm it’s authorized to see certain data or perform certain tasks (like reading local files or analyzing the user’s webcam feed).

Result: Nova has a decent user model. This helps sub-agents tailor responses (like BeliefAgent focusing on user beliefs, ReflectionAgent focusing on user introspection, DeveloperAgent for coding tasks, etc.).

2.3. Step C: Checking & Initializing Memory Layers
	1.	Episodic / Chunked Memory
	•	Nova can do a quick “load or refresh” of any recent conversation logs, ephemeral PDF chunks, or last session’s logs in the vector store.
	•	Possibly summarizing them into a short context note so Nova “knows” the immediate backlog.
	2.	Semantic (Neo4j) Memory
	•	Query the knowledge graph for any relevant stable facts about the user or last session’s tasks.
	•	If it’s the first session ever, Nova might create a “User node” or “Session node.”
	3.	Numeric Fact Store
	•	Nova ensures it can query the store if numeric data arises. Possibly a quick check: “Ok, we have the following numeric references for the user’s finances or environment. That’s loaded.”

Outcome: All memory layers get a small “handshake” or are verified ready. Nova notes if it’s empty or if it found relevant user facts.

2.4. Step D: Reflection & Reasoning (Optional)
	1.	ReflectionAgent
	•	Could run a short “internal reflection” to unify the new user data with existing memory.
	•	For instance, “We learned the user is now focusing on marketing. Let’s recall if we have stable marketing knowledge from last time. Does the user have constraints or preferences we remember?”
	2.	BeliefAgent
	•	Might adjust internal beliefs: “Now that we see the user is planning to do more dev tasks, we might expect more coding help.”
	3.	Nova Summarizes**:
	•	Possibly produce an internal “Initialization Summary” that ephemeral memory can store.
	•	“We are Nova, we have these sub-agents. The user is [Name], we aim to accomplish X, Y, Z.”

Thus: By the end of Step D, Nova is basically “ready for prime time.”

3. Example Implementation Flow

Pseudocode:

def nova_initialize():
    # Step A: Nova Identity
    nova_self_prompt = load_nova_system_prompt("nova_initialization.json")
    nova.load_self_identity(nova_self_prompt)
    
    # Step B: User Introduction
    user_profile = gather_user_profile()  # Could be a conversation or multi-modal intake
    store_in_memory(user_profile, memory_layer='episodic')  # ephemeral or partial in semantic if stable
    
    # Step C: Memory Layer Checks
    ephemeral_store = load_vector_store("episodic_vector_index")
    neo4j_kg = connect_neo4j()
    numeric_store = connect_numeric_db()
    
    # Step D: Reflection
    ReflectionAgent.run_reflection(nova, user_profile, ephemeral_store, neo4j_kg)
    
    BeliefAgent.update_beliefs(nova, user_profile)
    
    # Summarize
    initialization_summary = Nova.summarize_init_state(
      agents=[ReflectionAgent, BeliefAgent, ...], 
      tools=[OpenAI, AnthropicCompute, ...],
      user_profile=user_profile
    )
    ephemeral_store.add_chunk(initialization_summary)
    
    print("Nova initialization complete.")
    return # proceed to normal runtime

Note: This approach is conceptual. The actual code depends on your architecture (like how you store “self prompts” or how you call sub-agents).

4. Potential Multi-Modal Aspects
	•	If you want Nova to see the user visually, you might have a “VisionAgent” interpret the user’s expression or environment. Then store in ephemeral memory something like “User is wearing a business outfit, might be in an office.”
	•	If the user shares a short video or image, again, ephemeral memory can store the result of the analysis, or if it’s stable info (“User’s office has brand logos on the wall,” maybe store in semantic memory).

All up to how you want to expand beyond textual interactions.

5. Why This Protocol Helps
	1.	Clarity: Everyone (Nova, sub-agents, user) begins each session or lifecycle with a mutual understanding of goals, tools, memories.
	2.	Prevents Confusion: Rather than ad-hoc discovering the user’s identity or environment mid-session, Nova already has it pinned from the start.
	3.	Enables Multi-Modal: The system can gather relevant non-text data if you want that advanced capability.
	4.	Maintains Distinctions: If Nova is not a “simple orchestrator,” this initial step underscores Nova’s meta-cognitive role, forging its identity and synergy with sub-agents.

6. Conclusion
	•	Nova can have a structured initialization that ensures it clearly knows its own role, the user’s identity and preferences, its available memory layers (episodic vs. semantic), and its specialized sub-agents or tools.
	•	The User Introduction step can be multi-modal if desired, letting Nova truly appreciate the user’s context or environment from day one.
	•	The Memory checks align ephemeral chunk retrieval with stable facts in Neo4j or numeric data, ensuring from the get-go that Nova can unify them.
	•	Reflection solidifies Nova’s internal state so it’s not passively waiting but actively prepared to handle tasks.

This protocol sets a strong foundation for your advanced multi-agent system, clarifying Nova’s purpose and collaboration model from the start, rather than making Nova “just another orchestration layer.”

Below is a more technical, implementation-oriented version of the earlier plan. It discusses how to integrate Nova’s metacognition (with user data updates) and a split knowledge graph (with personal vs. professional domains), including concrete approaches for labeling, storing data, restricting agent access, and updating Nova’s internal “self-model” in code-like steps.

1. Technical Implementation for Nova’s Metacognition

1.1. Internal Structures for Metacognition
	1.	Nova’s “Self Model” Node in Neo4j
	•	Create or designate a node (:SystemSelf { name: "Nova" }) in the knowledge graph.
	•	Attach properties or relationships reflecting Nova’s current beliefs, desires, and reflection states. For instance:

MERGE (n:SystemSelf { name: "Nova" })
ON CREATE SET n.created_at = timestamp()


	•	Then store key-value properties for Nova’s metacognitive state, e.g. n.current_tone = "detail-oriented", or link to sub-nodes representing “BeliefAgent,” “DesireAgent,” etc.

	2.	Agents as Sub-Nodes
	•	Each specialized agent can be a sub-node or entity, e.g. (:Agent {name: "BeliefAgent", role: "manages beliefs"}).
	•	This helps track agent capabilities or internal states in the KG if needed.
	3.	Reflection & Belief Updates
	•	When new user data arrives (e.g., user’s personality info or diaries), Nova triggers a “Reflect” process:

def reflect_on_user_data(new_data):
    # 1. Analyze how new_data changes Nova’s approach (like user is "detail-oriented")
    # 2. Write or update a relationship or property on the :SystemSelf node
    session.run("""
      MERGE (n:SystemSelf { name: 'Nova' })
      SET n.conversational_style = $style
    """, style="detailed_because_of_user_profile")


	•	The BeliefAgent might store new beliefs as relationships from (:SystemSelf) to (:Belief { ... }).

	4.	Local In-Memory Representation
	•	Optionally, you can keep a Python dictionary or small object representing Nova’s “self-model” in memory, then mirror changes to Neo4j. This ensures quick local reads for ephemeral tasks, with a durable record in the KG for referencing across sessions.

Result: Nova’s metacognition is actively written into the graph or an internal data structure. Each time user info changes, Nova or sub-agents update these “self-state” nodes or properties.

1.2. Example Code Snippet (Pseudo-Python)

def update_nova_self_property(key: str, value: Any):
    """Update a property on the :SystemSelf node in Neo4j."""
    with neo4j_driver.session() as session:
        session.run("""
            MERGE (n:SystemSelf {name: 'Nova'})
            SET n[$prop] = $val
        """, prop=key, val=value)
    
def reflect_on_new_user_info(user_personality):
    # Example logic
    style = determine_conversational_style(user_personality)
    update_nova_self_property("conversational_style", style)
    # Possibly also update ephemeral Python state
    nova_self_cache["conversational_style"] = style

2. Handling a Shared Knowledge Graph (Personal + Professional Data)

2.1. Labeling / Partitioning Strategy
	1.	Domain Label or Property
	•	Each node can have a property domain: 'personal' or domain: 'work'. Alternatively, you can keep separate labels:
	•	(:PersonalNode { ... })
	•	(:WorkNode { ... })
	•	Edges can carry domain info if they link cross-domain concepts, e.g. (:PersonalNode)-[:RELATED {domain: 'mixed'}]->(:WorkNode).
	2.	Separate Subgraphs in the Same DB
	•	If a node is personal, it never has edges into the “work” subgraph unless the user explicitly merges them.
	•	(:User { name: "Alice", domain:'personal' })-[:HAS_JOURNAL]->(:DiaryEntry { ... }).
	3.	Access Control
	•	If you use Neo4j Enterprise or a custom approach, you can define “user roles” or agent roles that can only read from certain domain-labeled nodes.
	•	Or do it in your code logic: “MemoryAgent (for personal diaries) can only query domain='personal' nodes; WorkAgent sees only domain='work'.”

Result: Personal diaries or user reflections exist in (:DiaryEntry {domain:'personal'}) nodes, while marketing tasks might be (:WorkTask {domain:'work'}). Nova can see both, but sub-agents only see relevant domains.

**2.2. Examples of Querying & Storing

Store a Personal Diary Entry

def store_personal_diary(diary_text, user_id):
    with neo4j_driver.session() as session:
        session.run("""
            MATCH (u:User {id: $uid, domain:'personal'})
            CREATE (entry:DiaryEntry {text: $text, domain:'personal', created: timestamp()})
            CREATE (u)-[:HAS_JOURNAL]->(entry)
        """, uid=user_id, text=diary_text)

Store a Work Project

def store_work_task(task_name, project_id):
    with neo4j_driver.session() as session:
        session.run("""
            MATCH (p:Project {id: $pid, domain:'work'})
            CREATE (t:WorkTask {name: $tname, domain:'work', status:'pending'})
            CREATE (p)-[:HAS_TASK]->(t)
        """, pid=project_id, tname=task_name)

Reading

In code, you check domain:

def get_personal_entries(user_id):
    return session.run("""
        MATCH (u:User {id:$uid, domain:'personal'})-[:HAS_JOURNAL]->(entry:DiaryEntry {domain:'personal'})
        RETURN entry
    """, uid=user_id).data()

2.3. Multi-Agent Use in Code
	1.	Initialization
	•	Each agent is assigned a allowed_domains set in code. E.g.:

BeliefAgent.allowed_domains = ['personal', 'work']
MemoryAgent.allowed_domains = ['personal']
WorkAgent.allowed_domains = ['work']


	2.	Querying
	•	When an agent tries to query the KG, the code checks allowed_domains. If the agent tries to read domain=“personal” nodes but is not authorized, the query returns empty or a permission error.

Implementation:

def agent_query(agent, cypher_query):
    for domain_label in extract_domain_from_query(cypher_query):
        if domain_label not in agent.allowed_domains:
            raise PermissionError(f"{agent.name} not allowed in domain {domain_label}")
    # If allowed, proceed with query
    with neo4j_driver.session() as session:
        return session.run(cypher_query).data()

(Note: This is pseudo-code—real domain checks might parse the query or pass a domain parameter.)

3. Putting It All Together: Flow
	1.	Nova loads or updates its self-model in the KG (like (:SystemSelf {...})).
	2.	The user provides personal diaries or professional tasks.
	3.	Nova or a specialized agent stores them in the correct domain-labeled subgraph.
	4.	If a personal reflection sub-agent (ReflectionAgent) wants to see diaries, it does so in “personal” domain.
	5.	If a professional QAAgent wants to see technical tasks, it queries “work” domain.
	6.	Nova can see everything at a meta-level, bridging them only if user demands cross-domain analysis or link creation.

Key: The synergy between ephemeral memory (like chunk embeddings in a vector store) and the knowledge graph is the same. You can store ephemeral chunks with domain properties or keep them separate. If you want advanced node embeddings, you can do it domain by domain, or unify them under a single index with a “domain” field.

4. Additional Considerations
	1.	Node2Vec or GraphSAGE for Node Embeddings
	•	If you want advanced concept-level embeddings, pick a library (e.g., PyTorch Geometric or Neo4j Graph Data Science) that can produce embeddings.
	•	Each node’s embedding could be stored as a property, e.g. n.embedding = [0.1, 0.02, ...].
	•	Agents can do similarity queries across these node embeddings.
	•	Keep the domain label or property so you don’t mix personal vs. professional vectors inadvertently.
	2.	Mixed Domain
	•	If some knowledge is relevant to both personal and professional contexts (like user’s stress level affecting work?), you might create an edge or bridging node to represent that connection.
	•	That bridging node might require special approval from the user or Nova’s reflection logic.
	3.	Scalability
	•	As data grows, ensure your domain-labeled approach is consistent. Possibly implement partial- or multi-database setups if each domain becomes large.
	4.	Metacognition Over Time
	•	Periodically, Nova re-checks or updates (:SystemSelf) to see if new user info changes how it should orchestrate. E.g. once a month, run an internal reflection that merges ephemeral chunk data or relevant diaries into stable nodes.

Conclusion

A more technical approach for letting Nova handle metacognitive updates and maintain separate personal vs. professional data in a single knowledge graph includes:
	1.	Storing Nova’s self-state (beliefs, reflection states) in a (:SystemSelf) node (and sub-agent nodes) so that new user data triggers internal updates.
	2.	Domain-labeled or partitioned knowledge graph—domain:'personal' or domain:'work'—plus code-level domain restrictions for each sub-agent.
	3.	Chunk-based ephemeral memory remains a separate vector store, but also can reference domain or feed stable facts to the KG if they’re validated.
	4.	Implementation via consistent Cypher queries, code-level domain checks, and optional advanced node embeddings for concept-level retrieval.

This ensures Nova’s metacognition is truly active (agents reflect on new data) while personal vs. professional data remain properly siloed within one overarching knowledge graph.

Below is an updated, more focused proposal for implementing a FastAPI backend with a React frontend to replace Gradio/Streamlit. It includes technical steps, architectural considerations, and example snippets for bridging Nova (your multi-agent orchestrator) and the UI.

1. Overview: FastAPI + React
	1.	FastAPI (Python)
	•	Serves as your web server and API layer.
	•	Hosts Nova and sub-agent logic (the orchestrator, memory integration, etc.).
	•	Exposes endpoints (REST or WebSocket) for the React client.
	2.	React (JavaScript or TypeScript)
	•	Provides a rich user interface for conversation, emergent tasks, memory/KG views, agent management.
	•	Communicates with the FastAPI backend via HTTP or WebSockets.
	3.	Memory & Data Layer
	•	Neo4j (for long-term semantic data).
	•	Vector DB (like Qdrant or FAISS) for ephemeral chunk retrieval.
	•	Possibly a fact store (SQL or NoSQL) for numeric or key-value data.

2. FastAPI Backend

2.1. Project Structure

Example layout for your Python code:

nova_fastapi/
  ├── main.py                # FastAPI entry point
  ├── requirements.txt       # Dependencies
  ├── orchestrator/          # Nova & sub-agent logic
  │    ├── nova.py
  │    ├── belief_agent.py
  │    ├── reflection_agent.py
  │    └── ...
  ├── memory/                # Integration with Neo4j, vector DB, numeric store
  │    ├── neo4j_connector.py
  │    ├── vector_db.py
  │    └── ...
  └── ... (other modules, tools, etc.)

2.2. FastAPI Setup
	1.	Install FastAPI

pip install fastapi uvicorn


	2.	main.py Example

from fastapi import FastAPI, WebSocket
from pydantic import BaseModel
from orchestrator.nova import NovaOrchestrator  # hypothetical import

app = FastAPI()
nova = NovaOrchestrator()  # your main orchestrator instance

class UserMessage(BaseModel):
    message: str
    context: dict = {}

@app.post("/api/chat")
def chat_endpoint(msg: UserMessage):
    response = nova.process_user_input(msg.message, msg.context)
    return {"response": response}

@app.get("/api/tasks")
def get_tasks():
    return nova.get_current_tasks()

@app.websocket("/ws/chat")
async def chat_ws(websocket: WebSocket):
    await websocket.accept()
    while True:
        data = await websocket.receive_text()
        # Possibly parse & pass to nova, then return streaming updates
        ...


	3.	Running

uvicorn main:app --reload

	•	Serves your API at http://localhost:8000.

	4.	Nova (the orchestrator) uses sub-modules:
	•	For memory calls: neo4j_connector.py, vector_db.py.
	•	For sub-agents: e.g. BeliefAgent, ReflectionAgent.
	5.	Agent & Memory integration code is your existing or newly structured logic. The key is to expose simple methods that the FastAPI routes can call.

2.3. Detailed Considerations
	1.	Async vs. Sync
	•	FastAPI supports async def endpoints. If your Nova calls are I/O heavy or call external LLMs, using async might help concurrency.
	•	For real-time conversation updates, consider using the WebSocket route or SSE (Server-Sent Events).
	2.	Authentication
	•	If multi-user or secure usage is required, use FastAPI’s OAuth2 or JWT-based approach. The React app would store tokens and send them with requests.
	3.	Deployment
	•	You can run uvicorn directly or wrap it with something like gunicorn for production.
	•	Containerize with Docker if needed.

3. React Frontend

3.1. Project Structure

Example in a my-react-app/ folder:

my-react-app/
  ├── src/
  │    ├── components/
  │    ├── pages/
  │    ├── services/
  │    └── App.tsx
  ├── package.json
  ├── tsconfig.json
  └── ...

	1.	services/: Functions for calling the Python API:
	•	chatService.ts with sendChatMessage(...) or a websocketService.ts for real-time communication.
	2.	components/: Reusable UI blocks (ChatWindow, TaskList, KnowledgeGraphView).
	3.	pages/: High-level screens or routes (e.g., Home, Dashboard).

3.2. Communicating with FastAPI
	1.	REST Calls (simple user messages, tasks, etc.)

// src/services/chatService.ts
import axios from 'axios';

export async function sendChatMessage(text: string) {
  const response = await axios.post("/api/chat", { message: text });
  return response.data;
}


	2.	Displaying in a Chat Component

	3.	WebSocket (optional for real-time streaming)
	•	You could open a ws://localhost:8000/ws/chat socket from React, then handle onmessage to update the UI.

3.3. Additional UI Panels
	1.	Tasks List:
	•	GET /api/tasks returns current emergent tasks or multi-agent tasks.
	•	A component TasksPanel.tsx fetches and displays them, possibly letting user “approve,” “reject,” or “assign to an agent.”
	2.	Knowledge Graph Visualization:
	•	A route in FastAPI could do @app.get("/api/kg") to return node/edge data in JSON.
	•	React uses react-vis-network-graph or a D3-based approach to render.
	3.	Agent Management:
	•	Another endpoint might handle spawning or listing agents. The UI can show which sub-agents are active and their states.

4. Domain Separation (Personal vs. Work)
	1.	Endpoints:
	•	The same approach used in the last plan: your memory data in Neo4j might have a domain: 'personal' or domain:'work'.
	•	The React UI can show them in separate tabs or color-coding.
	2.	API:
	•	GET /api/tasks?domain=personal or work if you want to filter. Or you might store domain in your tasks themselves.
	•	The same concept for chat or diaries: a “domain” param can be sent in the request body.
	3.	Implementation:
	•	The server ensures that certain sub-agents or tasks only appear in the correct domain.
	•	The React UI organizes them accordingly.

5. Implementation Steps Summary
	1.	Restructure Nova code so it’s library-like, not dependent on Gradio calls.
	2.	Build a FastAPI app (main.py) that:
	•	Instantiates Nova (nova = NovaOrchestrator(...))
	•	Defines routes (/api/chat, /api/tasks, optional /ws/chat).
	3.	Create a React application with:
	•	A ChatWindow component for user messages.
	•	A TasksPanel or MultiAgentDashboard for emergent tasks & agent management.
	•	Optionally a KGViewer for memory/graph inspection.
	4.	Connect React to the Python server:
	•	Set "proxy": "http://localhost:8000" in package.json for local dev, or define base URLs in your services.
	•	Or handle CORS with fastapi.middleware.cors.
	5.	Test:
	•	Run uvicorn main:app --reload.
	•	npm start or yarn start in your React directory.
	•	Interact with the UI, see if chat or tasks updates are flowing properly.
	6.	Enhance with real-time:
	•	If you want live streaming or partial generation from Nova, implement a WebSocket or SSE route in FastAPI and a corresponding React hook to handle updates line-by-line.

6. Conclusion
	•	Switching to a FastAPI + React stack means you gain a full custom front end for conversations, agent displays, memory visualizations, etc., plus a powerful, flexible Python backend for Nova’s multi-agent logic.
	•	Implementation Steps revolve around:
	1.	Creating or reusing your existing multi-agent code (Nova, sub-agents).
	2.	Wrapping them in a FastAPI server with endpoints.
	3.	Building a React UI that calls these endpoints for chat, tasks, memory browsing, etc.
	•	This approach gives you far more control over UI design and scalability than a simpler framework like Gradio or Streamlit, while letting you keep the robust Python environment for agent orchestration.
