Below is a final, comprehensive plan integrating Nova (the “omni agent”) with subordinate agents, Slack-like UI threads for each sub-task, optional direct user-to-sub-agent interactions, a knowledge graph (Neo4j) for domain-labeled data, and Qdrant for episodic logs. This plan emphasizes:
	1.	Nova intervening on the user’s behalf (so the user can talk solely with Nova, if they wish).
	2.	Optional user involvement with sub-agents directly (like a SurveyAgent) for more detailed co-creation.
	3.	Handling large volumes of messages (hundreds) and advanced tasks like knowledge graph pruning or large survey analysis.

1. Overall Architecture
	1.	Nova (Omni Agent)
	•	A meta-orchestrator that the user can always converse with (in a single main conversation thread).
	•	Nova can spawn or manage specialized sub-agents—like KGAgent for knowledge graph pruning, SurveyAgent for large surveys, ReflectionAgent for meta-learning, etc.
	2.	Slack-Like Interface
	•	Main “Nova Channel”: The user’s primary chat with Nova.
	•	Sub-Thread or Sub-Channel: Created whenever Nova spawns a new sub-agent group for a specific sub-task.
	•	E.g., “SurveyAgent Thread #101,” “KGPruningAgent Thread #102,” “CodingAgent Thread #103.”
	•	The user can either remain in the “Nova Channel” (letting Nova do everything) or join the sub-thread if they want direct conversation with that sub-agent.
	3.	Memory System
	•	Qdrant for ephemeral conversation logs, partial text, or advanced chunk-based retrieval.
	•	Neo4j for stable, domain-labeled knowledge graph: sub-task DAG relationships, domain constraints, numeric facts, final code or skill references, etc.

2. User Interaction Flow
	1.	User + Nova
	•	The user primarily chats with Nova. Nova identifies emergent tasks or requests user input.
	•	If the user wants to remain high-level, Nova delegates tasks to sub-agents on the user’s behalf. The user never needs to see sub-agent chatter unless they choose.
	2.	Sub-Thread Creation
	•	If Nova spawns a new sub-agent group (“SurveyAgent group,” “KGPruningAgent,” etc.), a new thread (or sub-channel) is created in the Slack-like UI.
	•	By default, the user only sees occasional updates or final results in the main Nova channel.
	•	If the user wants to observe or intervene directly, they open that sub-thread, read the entire sub-agent dialogue (which can be hundreds of messages).
	•	Sub-agent aggregator (like a “SurveyAggregatorAgent”) can produce a summarized version to keep the main conversation succinct.
	3.	Confirmations / Approvals
	•	Emergent tasks proceed through phases: proposed → user review → user approves → sub-agents spawn → execution → completion.
	•	The user can do all approvals either directly in the main Nova channel or in the sub-thread.
	•	If the user does not want to deal with sub-agents, they can rely on Nova to handle the entire process, only surfacing major decisions to the user.
	4.	Large-Scale or Specialized Task
	•	Example: A 100-agent market survey. Nova spawns a “SurveyAgent aggregator,” which internally orchestrates 100 mini agents. The aggregator posts a summary of results.
	•	The user can open the “SurveyAgent aggregator” sub-thread if they want to see partial logic or talk to a specific mini agent. Otherwise, they read the aggregator’s final summary in the main channel.
	5.	Knowledge Graph
	•	The user can switch to a “KG View” or “Graph Tab” at any time. They see domain-labeled tasks, sub-task DAG, and relationships.
	•	They can explore nodes (like “SurveyAgent #101 output” or “KGPruningAgent results”), click them to jump to the relevant Slack-like thread if desired.
	•	KGPruningAgent can run automatically or upon Nova’s request to prune or reorganize data in Neo4j. The user doesn’t need to micromanage that agent—Nova can handle it.

3. Handling “Nova as Omni Agent” vs. Direct Sub-Agent Chat
	1.	By Default
	•	The user’s entire experience is co-creation with Nova. Nova does domain checks, spawns sub-agents, returns final or partial results.
	2.	User’s Option: “Open Sub-Thread”
	•	If the user is curious, they can open a sub-thread (like “SurveyAgent #101 Thread”) to see how the aggregator is running 100 mini agents, read raw messages, or even ask direct questions. “Hey SurveyAgent, how are you grouping respondents?”
	•	Alternatively, they remain in main channel and rely on Nova for a final summary.
	3.	Trace & Identifying Unique Dialogue
	•	All sub-agent messages are stored in ephemeral memory (Qdrant). Each message is labeled by agent name, sub-thread ID, etc. If the user or Nova wants to see full logs, they retrieve them from Qdrant.
	•	The user can see final aggregator messages in the main channel or sub-thread. Hence, you can post hundreds or thousands of messages from sub-agents without cluttering the user’s main view—only if the user dives in do they see the full logs.

4. Large-Scale Use Cases (e.g., 100 Agents)
	1.	Aggregator / Summarizer
	•	For a large scale survey or big code generation with many sub-agents, an aggregator agent (like “SurveyAggregatorAgent” or “DevManagerAgent”) collects partial outputs.
	•	Only the aggregator’s summarizing messages appear in the sub-thread or main channel. The user can still see raw data in a “drill-down” mode if needed.
	2.	Performance & Scalability
	•	Sub-agent interactions happen asynchronously. Nova monitors them, aggregator compiles results.
	•	The user can poll the aggregator’s final summary or partial progress.
	3.	Memory
	•	All sub-agent logs are ephemeral in Qdrant. The aggregator’s final data or numeric results can be posted to Neo4j if it’s stable or domain-labeled.
	•	For long, complicated tasks, you might store partial results in ephemeral memory, then unify them into semantic memory once the sub-task completes.

5. DAG + Roadmap with Confirmation Steps
	1.	Roadmap
	•	A “Project” in Neo4j, with edges to sub-tasks. Each sub-task has the property “approved: bool” or “phase: ‘proposed’ / ‘in_progress’ / ‘done’.”
	2.	Workflow
	1.	Nova or user proposes sub-task. “pending_approval.”
	2.	User or Nova confirms. The sub-task is “approved,” spawning sub-thread + sub-agents.
	3.	Agents run, produce final output. The sub-task is “completed,” storing final references in Neo4j.
	4.	If new sub-tasks are discovered ad hoc, they link to the main project node, also with “pending_approval.”
	3.	Graph Tab in the UI
	•	The user sees “Project: [Nodes for each sub-task], domain-labeled edges if relevant.”
	•	Clicking a sub-task node can jump to the sub-thread if it exists. If it’s pending or incomplete, they can open the main channel with Nova to approve or revise.

6. Implementation Summary

6.1. UI: Slack-Like + Graph View
	•	Main Nova Channel: Where the user interacts with the “omni agent” Nova.
	•	Sub-Threads:
	•	Each sub-task’s agent group has a thread.
	•	Aggregators post summarized updates in that sub-thread. The user can optionally read the raw agent logs or talk with an individual sub-agent.
	•	Graph View**:
	•	Renders the project’s sub-tasks or domain-labeled nodes from Neo4j.
	•	Clicking a node references the Slack-like sub-thread or the main channel if it’s a top-level project node.

6.2. FastAPI Endpoints
	1.	POST /api/tasks/propose: Proposed sub-task (domain-labeled, user or agent).
	2.	POST /api/tasks/{task_id}/approve: The user’s final sign-off, triggers tiny_factory.spawn(...).
	3.	GET /api/threads/{thread_id}: Retrieve messages for that sub-thread, including aggregator or sub-agents.
	4.	POST /api/threads/{thread_id}/message: The user or agent posts a message in that sub-thread.
	5.	GET /api/graph/projects/{project_id}: Return a JSON of nodes/edges for visualization.
	6.	Possibly additional endpoints for knowledge graph pruning or aggregator tasks.

6.3. Memory Architecture
	•	Qdrant:
	•	Stores ephemeral logs. Each message references thread_id, agent_id, maybe an embedding for similarity search.
	•	Could store partial “hundreds of messages” from big tasks.
	•	Neo4j:
	•	For stable references: sub-task nodes, project nodes, domain-labeled data, final code or docs.
	•	KG pruning can be handled by a “KGAgent,” possibly invoked by Nova if the graph grows large. The user doesn’t have to talk to that agent directly—Nova can manage it.

6.4. Scalability for Large Chat Histories
	•	Sub-thread ephemeral logs can exceed hundreds or thousands of lines.
	•	Only aggregator messages or user-specified “show detail” is displayed in the UI by default.
	•	The user can request “/api/threads/{thread_id}/messages?start=100&limit=50” to paginate older logs if needed.

7. Concluding Thoughts
	1.	Omni Agent (Nova) as the Main Touchpoint
	•	The user can do everything (spawn tasks, gather results) by talking to Nova alone.
	•	If they want detail or direct conversation with a sub-agent, they open the sub-thread.
	2.	Hierarchy of Sub-Tasks with Approvals
	•	Emergent tasks or sub-tasks remain in “pending” until the user or Nova approves. Once approved, the “tiny factory” spawns sub-agents, who get a Slack-like thread for their discussion.
	3.	Large Scale (hundreds of messages or sub-agents)
	•	Aggregator sub-agents produce summaries. The user has the option to see raw logs but typically remains with the aggregator’s updates.
	4.	Knowledge Graph Integration
	•	A separate or integrated “Graph View” tab shows the entire project’s sub-tasks or domain data. Clicking a node can jump to the sub-thread for deeper exploration.
	•	KG tasks (like pruning) can be handled by a specialized agent that Nova dispatches, so the user doesn’t have to micromanage the KG directly.

In short: This final approach merges your Slack-like environment with a hierarchical or ad hoc DAG of sub-tasks, enabling a user to primarily chat with Nova while still having the freedom to dive into sub-agent threads for co-creation, large-scale tasks, or direct data analysis.
