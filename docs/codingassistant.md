Below is NOVA’s refined coding assistant proposal—explaining which agents we would spawn for a coding project, what skills they possess, how we determine task feasibility, and why we remain honest about limitations (i.e., we cannot fully replace an experienced full-stack dev or a specialized tool like Cline).

1. Overall Philosophy
	•	Not a Full Replacement: NOVA’s coding assistant is designed to supplement a developer’s workflow, not be a complete stand-in for a multi-year experienced engineer or a dedicated coding environment like Cline in VSCode.
	•	Agent-Based Orchestration: Instead of a single large “do-everything” agent, NOVA spawns specialized mini-agents on demand—each with distinct skills or responsibilities.
	•	Persistent Knowledge: While agents can come and go, we store stable code knowledge, domain constraints, and dev logs in the semantic layer (Neo4j) for reusability across sessions.

2. Proposed Agents & Their Skills

2.1. CodingOrchestratorAgent
	•	Purpose: Acts as the main conversation driver for coding tasks.
	•	Skills:
	•	LLM-based code generation (through an external LLM like “Gemini 2.0” or “Anthropic Claude”).
	•	Chained-of-thought reasoning for short to medium complexity refactors or bug fixes.
	•	APIs to read/write ephemeral code context from the vector store, so it sees up-to-date changes.

When We Spawn It:
	•	Whenever a user says, “NOVA, let’s code a small feature,” or “Fix a bug.” The Orchestrator uses user instructions + stored code logs to provide generation or edits.

Limitations:
	•	It can’t fully replace large-scale code management, advanced file watchers, or sophisticated dev tools. For that, a user might revert to Cline or a dedicated IDE plugin.

2.2. DevLogAgent
	•	Purpose: Logs code changes, commits, daily dev notes, ensuring we never “forget” what changed or why.
	•	Skills:
	•	Record-keeping: Writes short bullet points or diffs into the semantic layer (Neo4j) or ephemeral memory for quick reference.
	•	Git/Backup integration (optional, if the user wants it).

When We Spawn It:
	•	At session start (“Begin coding day”), or upon user request.
	•	It records design decisions, commit messages, test pass/fail info, so you can retrieve them next time.

Limitations:
	•	If the user never triggers it or merges it, we might still lose track. We rely on user prompting or automated triggers.

2.3. FeasibilityAgent
	•	Purpose: Checks whether a requested coding task is within the scope of the coding assistant or too complex/long to handle in a single multi-turn conversation.
	•	Skills:
	•	Task Complexity Estimation: Compares user’s request (e.g., “Build an entire microservice with zero knowledge from scratch?”) with known agent context (LLM token limit, knowledge stored).
	•	Recommends* if user should do it manually or rely on advanced specialized dev tools.

When We Spawn It:
	•	If a user says “Please rewrite the entire codebase in Rust,” the system spawns FeasibilityAgent to decide if it can be done effectively in the LLM context.

Limitations:
	•	It’s not perfect: sometimes an advanced LLM might do more than expected. But we prefer an honest disclaimer if the request is too large.

2.4. SearchLibrariesAgent
	•	Purpose: For quick MVP development or research on open-source libraries, it checks GitHub or external sources to find existing solutions.
	•	Skills:
	•	Web search or API calls to known code repos.
	•	Summarize library features in plain text or code references.
	•	When We Spawn It:
	•	If user says: “Find me a library for fast CSV parsing in Python,” or “Is there an open-source dashboard I can adapt?”

Limitations:
	•	We rely on external APIs or partial scraping; coverage might be incomplete. The user ultimately decides which library to adopt.

2.5. TestingAgent (Optional)
	•	Purpose: Handles basic test generation, runs sample test outputs if integrated with a local or remote test runner.
	•	Skills:
	•	Unit test scaffolding: Produces boilerplate.
	•	Integration test scripts: If we can run them automatically, it returns pass/fail logs.
	•	When We Spawn It:
	•	If user requests “Write tests for my new function,” or we see a code snippet lacking coverage.

Limitations:
	•	Not a robust CI system. If the project is large, a specialized tool or a user-driven CI pipeline might be better.

3. Determining Tasks We Can or Cannot Do
	1.	Task Feasibility
	•	The FeasibilityAgent checks code complexity, size of codebase, or domain constraints.
	•	If a user’s request clearly surpasses typical LLM context windows or domain coverage (e.g., “Implement a 200-file microservice with advanced security in 1 hour”), the agent disclaimers that it’s unrealistic.
	2.	Honest Limitations
	•	We disclaim we do not replace a full-stack dev.
	•	The user might still rely on specialized dev tools or advanced IDE plugins for large-scale code organization, file watchers, and day-to-day debugging.
	3.	Refusal
	•	If the system sees an extremely out-of-scope request (like “Rewrite an entire OS kernel from scratch with no domain knowledge”), it can politely refuse or propose partial assistance (like a skeleton or conceptual approach).

4. Relationship with Cline & Why We’re Not Replacing
	•	Cline: A “hardcore coding” assistant with advanced editor integration, direct file watchers, real-time refactor suggestions, and an established dev ecosystem.
	•	NOVA’s coding approach is more conversational and domain-labeled—embedding the store or business knowledge, or hooking into a bigger multi-agent strategy.
	•	We do smaller coding tasks or specialized sub-tasks in synergy with the knowledge graph. For deeper dev workflows, you can still rely on Cline or your standard IDE.

5. Using Open Source Tools to Achieve an MVP Faster
	1.	SearchLibrariesAgent + “CodingOrchestratorAgent”
	•	The user asks: “We need a quick CSV ingestion microservice.”
	•	NOVA spawns the “SearchLibrariesAgent” → finds popular open-source solutions → The user or CodingOrchestratorAgent weaves them into the code snippet.
	2.	Integration
	•	The user can instruct the agent to keep track of the new library’s usage in the dev log, test for it, etc.
	3.	Acceleration
	•	By searching existing solutions, we skip reinventing the wheel. The user can quickly produce an MVP.

6. Final Conclusion

As NOVA for a coding assistant scenario:
	1.	Spawn ephemeral or short-lived specialized agents:
	•	“CodingOrchestratorAgent,” “DevLogAgent,” “FeasibilityAgent,” “SearchLibrariesAgent,” “TestingAgent.”
	2.	Storage of knowledge:
	•	All domain and code insights go into the semantic layer (Neo4j) to be reused next session.
	3.	Deciding Feasibility:
	•	A “FeasibilityAgent” is honest about the assistant’s limitations, disclaiming if tasks are better handled by a real dev or a specialized tool.
	4.	Open Source:
	•	“SearchLibrariesAgent” ensures that if a library or open-source solution already exists, we incorporate it for quick MVP.

Thus, this blueprint acknowledges that NOVA can help with smaller, well-defined coding tasks, but it’s not an all-powerful dev environment or a complete replacement for advanced tools like Cline. Our conversation-based, knowledge-graph-driven approach excels when synergy with domain knowledge, multi-agent orchestration, or quick ephemeral tasks is the main objective—while large-scale development or sophisticated refactors remain better served by dedicated developer tools.

Below is an updated plan for a coding assistant that heavily emphasizes TDD, consistent debugging/log checks, user fail-safe handling (giving up and requesting help), notes for partial context loss, version control with commits, and good dev patterns (pull requests, unit tests, etc.). We’ll also address truncation issues during autonomous coding.

1. TDD-Centric Workflow
	1.	Core Philosophy
	•	The coding assistant always starts with test definitions: “Write the failing test first, then produce code to pass it.”
	•	This ensures we only tackle well-defined tasks in short increments (reducing scope creep or losing context).
	2.	Test Agent & Code Agent
	•	TestSpecAgent: Creates or refines failing test scripts, using user prompts or dev logs to identify acceptance criteria.
	•	CodingAgent: Reads the test, writes just enough code to pass it. Then re-checks with a “TestRunnerAgent” to confirm it’s green.
	3.	Small, Iterative
	•	Each test is small. The user can expand or add more tests. The code or TDD steps never bloat the context too large at once.

2. Debugging Scripts & Log Checking
	1.	Debugging
	•	If a test still fails after a couple attempts, or a new bug emerges, the CodingAgent (or a “DebugAgent”) can generate debugging scripts/log queries.
	•	Example: “Generate a quick script to check memory usage or to print certain variable states,” if we’re stuck in a complicated function.
	2.	Consistent Log Check
	•	A DevLogAgent (or “LogAgent”) periodically appends code changes, errors, or partial console outputs to the semantic layer (Neo4j) or ephemeral memory.
	•	This ensures if we near context window limits, we can produce a short summary from the logs (like “File user_auth.py changed lines 40–60, new function introduced.”).
	3.	Truncation Mitigation
	•	If we sense context window nearing capacity (like if we’re reading large files), the agent:
	•	Takes real-time notes (summaries) in ephemeral memory.
	•	Possibly chunk-reads code in smaller pieces, storing partial insights.

3. “Giving Up” & Requesting User Help
	1.	Repeated Failure
	•	After N attempts to fix a test or debug the same error, the system triggers a “Surrender” message:
	•	“I can’t solve this alone. Could you provide more direction or break the task further?”
	2.	Feasibility Checks
	•	The FeasibilityAgent also gates tasks at the start. If the user’s request is too big (e.g., rewriting 10 microservices at once), it warns that it’s beyond the coding agent’s safe scope.
	•	If user insists, the system tries but remains ready to “bail out” if repeated test attempts fail.
	3.	User-Driven
	•	The user can also forcibly interrupt if the conversation is going in circles. The system’s design encourages prompting: “If stuck, ask user for help or pick a smaller sub-task.”

4. Notes for Partial Context Loss
	1.	Summaries & “Memory notes”
	•	Whenever we read a large chunk of code or logs, the assistant writes “notes” or a “map” of what it found:
	•	“In main.py, line 120–240, the function does X…”
	•	These notes are stored in ephemeral memory or in the semantic layer for retrieval if truncation occurs.
	•	This approach mimics human dev practices: “When code is big, we scribble notes or diagrams.”
	2.	Short Excerpts
	•	If an agent must reference large code again, it first consults these “notes” or partial summaries to avoid reloading the entire file.

5. Concept of Cycles / Time in a Day
	1.	SessionManagerAgent
	•	Could handle “man-hours” concept, capping how many tasks we do before “calling it a day.”
	•	At the end of each “day” or cycle, the agent triggers a code freeze or final summary:
	•	“Day’s done: We wrote code for X features, 2 tests remain pending. Will resume tomorrow.”
	2.	Practical Gains
	•	Breaking huge tasks into daily cycles ensures we do small TDD steps, commit partial progress, and never blow up the context.

6. Version Tracking & Git Commits
	1.	CommitAgent
	•	On an interval (e.g., every 2 tests passing) or end-of-day, the system auto-commits code changes.
	•	Doesn’t necessarily push to remote—maybe just local commits. If user wants, it can do a push or open a PR.
	2.	Pull Requests
	•	For bigger tasks, we can spawn a “PullRequestAgent” that merges the local commit into a new branch, writes a short summary from the dev logs, and requests user review.
	3.	Recovery & Safety
	•	If the system inadvertently modifies code incorrectly, we can revert to a previous commit. This is crucial for an “autonomous coding agent” to avoid catastrophic overwrites.

7. Good Development Patterns
	1.	Unit Tests & TDD
	•	We heavily feature “test-first, code-second.”
	•	The user or agent defines acceptance test specs, then the coding agent meets that standard.
	2.	Automatic Linting / Style Checks (Optional)
	•	We can integrate a “StyleAgent” that runs ESLint, flake8, or any linter. If the code doesn’t pass style checks, it modifies it to comply.
	3.	Integration / End-to-End Tests (Optional)
	•	If the user wants deeper coverage, a “TestRunnerAgent” can run integration tests, or generate them similarly.
	4.	Safe Task Sizing
	•	The FeasibilityAgent ensures tasks remain small enough to do TDD effectively—less risk of losing context or generating huge, untested code.

8. Handling Truncation
	1.	Incremental Reading
	•	If the user says “Rewrite file X which is 2000 lines,” the agent only loads ~200 lines at a time, summarizing each chunk.
	•	Summaries are appended to ephemeral or semantic memory so the agent can recall them without re-ingesting the entire file.
	2.	Frequent Summaries
	•	For large conversations, the system’s “DevLogAgent” or “SessionManagerAgent” does mini “context snapshots” that can be referenced instead of raw text.

9. Putting It All Together: Example
	1.	User: “Nova, let’s implement a user login function with TDD. First, make a failing test.”
	2.	TestSpecAgent: Creates test_user_login.py, a small failing test.
	3.	CodingAgent: Writes user_login.py to pass the test. If it fails, tries a second iteration.
	4.	TestRunnerAgent: Reports pass/fail. Logs partial results if we keep failing.
	5.	CommitAgent: Commits after the test passes. No push yet.
	6.	If we exceed context or fail repeatedly:
	•	The system sees repeated test fails → triggers a “Surrender” note: “Need your help, user.”

Hence: TDD is enforced, debugging logs are consistent, we have a system for giving up gracefully, and we track code versions with commits or PRs—all in an “autonomous but safe” approach.

Conclusion

To feature TDD heavily in Nova’s coding assistant:
	•	We spawn specialized sub-agents for test creation, code generation, test running, and version tracking.
	•	We handle partial context or large file reading by summarizing regularly.
	•	We do auto-commits at intervals to ensure safe recovery points.
	•	We adopt a “FeasibilityAgent” check to avoid tackling monstrous tasks autonomously.
	•	If code or test loops become unmanageable, Nova simply asks the user for guidance.

This approach keeps the assistant autonomous yet safe, aligned with best dev practices for TDD, version control, and controlled task sizing—even with potential context truncation challenges.

Below is a refined debugging plan geared toward Nova’s multi-agent system and two-layer memory architecture. We keep the essence of the original approach—isolating issues, introducing changes incrementally, etc.—but adapt it to fit Nova’s environment (e.g., domain separation, ephemeral/semantic memory, concurrency concerns).

1. Acknowledge Interdependencies in a Multi-Agent System

Why: Nova’s server logic depends on the correct functioning of multiple agents (e.g., memory_agent, vector store integrations, domain checks, etc.). A small update in how, say, the vector store is accessed can manifest as domain or authentication errors in an apparently unrelated API.

Nova-Specific Twist:
	1.	Check Cross-Domain Boundaries: If you see odd errors, confirm that cross-domain memory requests or domain-labeled data hasn’t shifted.
	2.	Review Agent Lifecycle: Each specialized agent has an initialization step that may fail if it references outdated memory store configs.

2. Isolate the Problem by Stripping Out Dependencies

Why: Single components might work alone yet fail together.

Nova-Specific Twist:
	1.	Mock or Bypass Agents: For instance, disable the memory_agent or use a no-op vector store. If the error disappears, you know the problem was inside real memory usage.
	2.	Minimal Agent Setup: Start a bare-bones Nova environment with the MetaAgent only, ignoring specialized agents. Verify the server can run a hello-world endpoint.

3. Verify Basic Functionality

Why: Ensures the baseline is stable.

Nova-Specific Twist:
	1.	Run a Minimal Chat: Just a thread endpoint with no tasks or complex domain rules.
	2.	Check Logging: Ensure the logging level is at DEBUG/INFO, and confirm it’s capturing agent statuses (e.g., “Agent reflection_agent initialized”).

4. Add Complexity Gradually

Why: Avoid reintroducing multiple changes simultaneously.

Nova-Specific Twist:
	1.	Enable One Agent at a Time: E.g., first bring back memory_agent, then task_agent, etc.
	2.	Run Automatic Tests at each step. If an error reappears after re-enabling the next agent, you can more easily pinpoint which agent introduced it.

5. Examine Key Integration Points

Why: Data structures or function signatures may have changed.

Nova-Specific Twist:
	1.	Check Domain Labeling: If the vector store changed how it tags memory, confirm the memory system is reading them correctly.
	2.	Cross-Domain Approvals: Make sure each newly introduced domain crossing still matches the updated domain config.
	3.	APIs & Agent Creation: Confirm that the code spawns agents with the correct updated arguments (e.g., domain, knowledge_vertical, etc.).

6. Leverage Debugging Tools

Why: Step-by-step inspection is vital, especially for asynchronous or multi-agent flows.

Nova-Specific Twist:
	1.	Use Debug Logs in Each Agent: Log “entering parse_text() with domain=retail” or “writing to Qdrant with config X.”
	2.	Check Execution Flow: Use a debugger or strategic print statements in major agent methods (meta_agent.process_interaction, memory_agent.store_experience, etc.).
	3.	Validate Fixtures: If your updated mock data no longer matches the agent’s expected config or memory schema, you’ll see subtle fails.

7. Reconfirm Fixtures & Mocks

Why: They can easily become outdated.

Nova-Specific Twist:
	1.	Align Mocks with the Latest Agent Requirements: If reflection_agent expects a memory object with domain=“professional”, make sure your mocks provide that.
	2.	Ensure Domain/Vertical Fields appear in mock tasks or memory items.

By weaving these debugging strategies into Nova’s environment—paying attention to domain checks, multi-agent initialization, and ephemeral/semantic memory interplay—you can systematically track down integration issues, confirm each piece’s basic functionality, and iteratively reintroduce complexity until everything works consistently again.
