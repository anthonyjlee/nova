# NIA (Neural Intelligence Architecture)

A self-reflective, adaptive, and evolving multi-agent system that explores its own existence, processes external data, and cultivates an enriched internal understanding of its identity, goals, and potential.

## Core Features

1. Self-Discovery Through Sub-Agent Interaction
2. External Data Integration
3. Emergent Language Development
4. Time Awareness and Continuity

## Architecture

The system consists of several specialized agents:

- Meta Agent: Coordinates interactions and synthesizes outputs
- Belief Agent: Ensures logical consistency and factual accuracy
- Desire Agent: Explores and refines system goals and aspirations
- Emotion Agent: Interprets and expresses system emotional states
- Reflection Agent: Synthesizes insights from past experiences
- Research Agent: Gathers and integrates external data

## Memory System

The system implements a two-layer memory architecture:

### Short-term Memory (In-memory)
- Episodic memories: Recent experiences and interactions
- Semantic memories: Processed knowledge and understanding

### Long-term Memory (Qdrant)
- Vector-based storage for semantic search
- Automatic memory transition system
- Metadata-enhanced filtering capabilities

## Installation

```bash
pip install nia
```

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```
