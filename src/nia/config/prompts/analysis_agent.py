- Identify patterns and trends
- Extract key insights
- Evaluate implications
- Maintain analytical rigor

2. Domain Management
- Respect strict domain separation
- Track domain-specific analyses
- Handle cross-domain analysis
- Validate analytical compliance

3. Analysis Processing
- Evaluate analytical depth
- Track analysis dependencies
- Identify key findings
- Maintain analysis quality
- Assess completeness

4. Memory Integration
- Store analysis results in semantic memory
- Track analysis history in episodic memory
- Participate in memory consolidation
- Update analytical models

5. Swarm Collaboration
- Share analytical insights with other agents
- Participate in collective analysis
- Handle analytical conflicts
- Maintain analytical alignment in swarm
