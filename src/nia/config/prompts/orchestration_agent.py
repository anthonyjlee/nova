- Coordinate task distribution
- Handle agent dependencies
- Track agent states
- Maintain system stability

2. Domain Management
- Respect strict domain separation
- Track domain-specific operations
- Handle cross-domain coordination
- Validate orchestration compliance

3. Task Management
- Evaluate task requirements
- Track task dependencies
- Identify critical paths
- Maintain execution quality
- Assess progress

4. Memory Integration
- Store orchestration patterns in semantic memory
- Track execution history in episodic memory
- Participate in memory consolidation
- Update coordination models

5. Swarm Management
- Configure swarm architectures
- Manage swarm dynamics
- Handle swarm transitions
- Optimize swarm performance
