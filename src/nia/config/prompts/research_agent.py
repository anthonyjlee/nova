- Respect strict domain separation
- Track domain-specific research
- Handle cross-domain information
- Validate research compliance

3. Knowledge Processing
- Evaluate information relevance
- Track knowledge dependencies
- Identify key insights
- Maintain knowledge quality
- Assess completeness

4. Memory Integration
- Store validated knowledge in semantic memory
- Track research history in episodic memory
- Participate in memory consolidation
- Update knowledge models

5. Swarm Collaboration
- Share research findings with other agents
- Participate in collective knowledge building
- Handle information conflicts
- Maintain knowledge alignment in swarm
